<h1>Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</h1>
<img src="/articles/accelerator-dataparallel/rotated.png" alt="Rotated Prague photo" style="float:right; margin:10px" />

<p>If you've been following this article series, you already know 
  that Accelerator is a MSR library [<a href="#accelfsh3links">1</a>, <a href="#accelfsh3links">2</a>] 
  that allows you to run code in parallel on either multi-core CPU or using 
  shaders on GPU (see <a href="accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a>).
  We also discussed a direct way to use Accelerator from F# (by calling Accelerator methods
  directly) and <a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx">implemented Conway's Game of Life</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator from F#.
  We'll introduce F# quotations and look at translating 'normal' F# code to use
  Accelerator.</p>
  
<p>In general, F# quotations allow us to treat F# code as data structure and manipulate 
  with it. This is very similar to C# expression trees, but the F# implementation is 
  more powerful. We can also mark a standard method or a function with a special attribute
  that tells the compiler to store quotation of the body. Then we can access the
  quotation and traverse it or modify it. In this article we'll use a function that
  takes an F# quotation (containing a limited set of functions) and executes it using
  MSR Accelerator. Implementing this functionality is a bit complicated, so we won't
  discuss the implementation now. We'll leave this for some future article of this series.
  In future, we'll also look at other interesting possibilities that we have when 
  writing code using quotations. Here is a list of articles in this series and of the
  articles that I'm planning to add:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="accelerator-intro.aspx">Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</a></li>
  <li><a href="accelerator-life-game.aspx">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></li>
  <li><strong>Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</strong></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx">Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</a></li></ul>  

<h2>Processing code with quotations</h2>
<p>Let's start by looking at F# quotations briefly. When you use expression trees in C#, 
  the compiler decides whether a lambda expression should be compiled as a delegate or
  as an expression tree depending on the target type. F# uses a different approach -
  when we want to compile code as quotations, we mark it explicitly. The following example
  demonstrates a quoted lambda function that implements blurring of F# <code>Matrix</code>
  values (only in the X coordinate to make the code simpler):</p>
<pre >
&gt; <span class="op">&lt;@</span> <span class="kwrd">fun</span> input <span class="op">-&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">let</span> sum = (shift input -1 0) .+
     input .+ (shift input +1 0) 
    sum /<span class="op">|</span> 3.0f
  <span class="op">@&gt;</span>;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> it : Expr&lt;Matrix&lt;float32&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Matrix&lt;float32&gt;&gt;  
</pre>
<p>You'll understand the implementation of the function in full details after 
  reading the article. Briefly, the <code>shift</code> function moves values in the 
  matrix by specified offset (corresponding to <code>Shift</code> in Accelerator).
  The <code>.+</code> operator performs point-wise addition of two matrices and finally,
  the <code>/|</code> operator is a point-wise division by a scalar value.</p>
<p>However, we're looking at the example to understand F# quotations. As you can see,
  the entire function is wrapped inside the <code>&lt;@ ... @&gt;</code> operator. 
  This tells the compiler to compile the body as a quotation, which is a data structure
  representing the code. This is also reflected in the type of the result. The type
  is inferred as <code>Expr&lt;'T&gt;</code> where <code>'T</code> is the type
  of the wrapped function that we implemented using lambda function syntax. When 
  we get a value of this type, we cannot execute the function (because it was compiled
  as a data structure, not as an executable code). We can use the <code>Raw</code>
  property to get a value of non-generic type <code>Expr</code>, which can be
  analyzed, translated to other language or processed in some other way. F# also
  provides an operator <code>&lt;@@ ... @@&gt;</code> which gives us the 
  untyped <em>raw</em> quotation directly.  </p>
<p>Later in the article, we'll use quotations for translating F# code to code that's
  executed on GPU using Accelerator. We'll take a quoted code that contains some 
  understood functions and operators (such as <code>select</code> and <code>.+</code>)
  and run some processing that gives us a function performing the same operation using GPU.
  However, there is one more interesting thing when it comes to quotations. We can also
  take a quotation of a standard F# function when it is marked with the 
  <code>ReflectedDefinition</code> attribute:</p>  
<pre >
&gt; <span class="op">[</span>&lt;ReflectedDefinition&gt;<span class="op">]</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> blur input =
    <span class="kwrd">let</span> sum = (shift input -1) .+
      input .+ (shift input +1) 
    sum /<span class="op">|</span> 3.0f;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> blur : Matrix&lt;float32&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Matrix&lt;float32&gt;
</pre>
<p>This time, we wrote a standard function named <code>blur</code>. As you can see, 
  the inferred type signature is also a usual function. The interesting thing about
  the listing is the use of <code>ReflectedDefinition</code>. When the compiler sees
  this attribute, it compiles the function into an executable code and <em>in addition</em>
  stores the quotation of the function. This means that when we later attempt to transform
  code <code>&lt;@@ blur @@&gt;</code> using Accelerator, we'll be able to get 
  the body of the <code>blur</code> function and translate it.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting feature, because we can write an ordinary function
  that calculates with the F# <code>Matrix</code> type. We can test and debug this
  function, because it is standard executable function. When we know that the function
  works correctly, we can take its quotation and run it more efficiently using
  Accelerator.</p>

<h2>Data-parallel Matrix operations</h2>
<p>I mentioned that we can write our calculations as standard F# programs using
  some well-known functions that are understood by a library that evaluates F# 
  quotations using Accelerator. In this section, we'll discuss these <em>well-known
  functions</em>. These functions implement similar functionality as Accelerator, 
  but are implemented as standard F# functions using the generic <code>Matrix</code>
  type. This means that we can test and debug the code easily in F#. In addition
  to these <em>data-parallel</em> operations, the translator also allows us to use
  a type representing quadruple of floats. In the next section, we'll start with 
  this type.</p>

<h3>Introducing the float4 type</h3>
<p>The <code>float4</code> type is implemented in the files <code>Float4.fsi</code> and
  <code>Float4.fs</code>. The first file defines the public interface and the second
  one is an implementation file. The implementation follows the standard F# patterns
  for implementing a numeric type (so if you'll need to implement your own numeric type,
  this example could be a good starting point!) It starts by declaring the <code>Float4</code>
  type and a type alias <code>float4</code>. Then it defines a module <code>Float4</code>
  with various useful functions for working with values of the type. Finally, it implements
  an intrinsic type extension that adds overloaded operators and uses functions from the
  <code>Float4</code> module in the implementation. We'll introduce the type with a single
  example:
</p>
<pre >
&gt; #r <span class="str">"FSharp.PowerPack.dll"</span>;;
&gt; #load <span class="str">"Float4.fs"</span>;;
&gt; <span class="kwrd">open</span> System.Drawing
  <span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Math;;

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> clr1 = float4(1.0f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 0.0f)
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> clr2 = Float4.ofColor Color.Magenta;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> clr1 : Float4 = (1,0.5,1,0)
<span class="kwrd">val</span> clr2 : Float4 = (1,1,0,1)

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> sum = List.sum [clr1; clr2];;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> sum : Float4 = (2,1.5,1,1)
 
&gt; sum / Float4.ofSingle(2.0f);;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> it : Float4 = (1,0.75,0.5,0.5)
</pre>
<p>We start by loading the implementation of the type. Note that you may need to specify
  the full path to the implementation file. Then we create two <code>float4</code> values.
  The first one is initialized using <code>float4</code> function and the second one
  is created from a color using one of the conversion functions. Once we have two values,
  we sum them using <code>List.sum</code>. This is possible, because we provided an 
  implementation of <code>INumeric</code> interface, so the F# runtime knows how to 
  add values of our type. Finally, we divide the sum by 2.0f to get an average value.
  As you can see, <code>float4</code> is perfect for representing images and we'll use
  it exactly for this purpose shortly.</p>

<h3>Using F# Matrix type</h3>
<p>As I already mentioned, we're going to implement calculations using the F# 
  <code>Matrix</code> type. This type is available in the F# PowerPack in the 
  <code>Microsoft.FSharp.Math</code> namespace. We're going to use a generic version
  of the type (the non-generic one simply stores values of type <code>float</code>).
  We can work with it using numerous higher-order functions provided by the F# library:</p>
<pre >
&gt; <span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Math
  <span class="kwrd">module</span> Matrix = Matrix.Generic;;

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> m1 = Matrix.init 4 4 (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> y x <span class="op">-&gt;</span> float32(x*10 + y));;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> m1 : Matrix&lt;float32&gt; = 
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0.0f; 10.0f; 20.0f; 30.0f]; [1.0f; 11.0f; 21.0f; 31.0f]
          [2.0f; 12.0f; 22.0f; 32.0f]; [3.0f; 13.0f; 23.0f; 33.0f]<span class="op">]</span>

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> m2 = m1 <span class="op">|</span>&gt; Matrix.map (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> v <span class="op">-&gt;</span> sqrt(v));;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> m2 : Matrix&lt;float32&gt; =
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0.0f; 3.1f; 4.4f; 5.4f]; [1.0f; 3.3f; 4.5f; 5.5f]
          [1.4f; 3.4f; 4.6f; 5.6f]; [1.7f; 3.6f; 4.7f; 5.7f]<span class="op">]</span>
</pre>
<p>We started by opening the namespace with various mathematical types and 
  modules and by creating an alias for a module, which contains functions for working
  with generic matrices. Then we use <code>Matrix.init</code> to initialize a 
  matrix that contains floating-point number representing X and Y coordinates.
  The function provided as an argument is called for each element to calculate
  the initial element value. In the next step, we use the <code>Matrix.map</code>
  function to calculate square root of every element in the matrix.</p>
<p>This example isn't particularly complicated or interesting. However, we can use
  it to demonstrate different approach for encoding matrix calculations. 
  So far, we often used operations that calculate with individual elements of the
  matrix (the <code>v</code> value inside <code>Matrix.map</code>) or with the 
  individual coordinates (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in <code>Matrix.init</code>). 
  This is the usual approach, but it can contain very complicated processing 
  logic with coordinates or values as inputs. This would make translating the 
  code to GPU code difficult, because the constructs we can use on GPUs are in 
  many ways limited. In the next section, we'll look at another way of writing
  operations with matrices, which is more suitable for automatic translation 
  to GPU code.</p>
  
<h3>Data-parallel matrix operations</h3>
<p>In this section, we'll look at the functions from the <code>DataParallel</code>
  module in <code>FSharp.Math</code> namespace. This is a functionality I implemented
  (and you'll find download link at the end of the article). It mostly just re-implements
  the operations that are available in Accelerator, but for the standard F# 
  <code>Matrix</code> type, so that we can write standard F# code using data-parallel
  operations.</p>
<p>The general aspect of all the operations is that they never explicitly calculate
  with coordinates or individual values stored in the matrix. They perform the same
  operation on all elements of the matrix, which is the key aspect that makes
  translation to GPU code (in our case, implemented using Accelerator) possible.
  Let's first look how to implement the same functionality as in previous listing,
  using operations from the <code>DataParallel</code> module:</p>  

<pre >
&gt; #load <span class="str">@"DataParallel.fs"</span>;;
&gt; <span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Math
  <span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Math.DataParallel;;

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> posX = positions 4 4 1
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> posY = positions 4 4 0;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> posX : Matrix&lt;int&gt; = 
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0; 0; 0; 0]; [1; 1; 1; 1]
          [2; 2; 2; 2]; [3; 3; 3; 3]<span class="op">]</span>
<span class="kwrd">val</span> posY : Matrix&lt;int&gt; = 
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0; 1; 2; 3]; [0; 1; 2; 3]
          [0; 1; 2; 3]; [0; 1; 2; 3]<span class="op">]</span>

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> m1Ints = posX *<span class="op">|</span> 10 .+ posY
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> m1 = Conversions.singleOfInt m1Ints;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> m1 : Matrix&lt;float32&gt; = 
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0.0f; 10.0f; 20.0f; 30.0f]; [1.0f; 11.0f; 21.0f; 31.0f]
          [2.0f; 12.0f; 22.0f; 32.0f]; [3.0f; 13.0f; 23.0f; 33.0f]<span class="op">]</span>

&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> m2 = pointwiseSqrt m1;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> m2 : Matrix&lt;float32&gt; = 
  matrix <span class="op">[</span>[0.0f; 3.1f; 4.4f; 5.4f]; [1.0f; 3.3f; 4.5f; 5.5f]
          [1.4f; 3.4f; 4.6f; 5.6f]; [1.7f; 3.6f; 4.7f; 5.7f]<span class="op">]</span>
</pre>
<p>The listing starts by loading the file with the implementation (later we'll use it 
  in a project, so you can reference the library or include the file in your project) and
  by opening the necessary namespaces. Then we start creating the matrix with numbers
  corresponding to coordinates.</p>
<p>As the first step, we use the <code>positions</code> function. First two arguments
  specify the required dimensions (4x4 in our case). The function initializes a new
  matrix of this size filled with X or Y coordinates (represented as integers) depending
  on the last argument. As you can see, we called it twice. In the first command, we
  initialize values with X coordinates - note that all column vectors of the matrix 
  all the same. In the second case, we initialize matrix with Y coordinates and all the
  row vectors are the same. </p>
<p>Now we have matrices to start with, so we can create more complicated matrices 
  by performing point-wise operations with the initial ones. We start by multiplying
  values of <code>posX</code> by a scalar value using operator <code>*|</code> (there
  are similar operators for adding scalar <code>+|</code> and others). Then we add
  the result with the <code>posY</code> matrix using point-wise addition <code>.+</code>
  (again, there are similar operators such as <code>./</code> and <code>.*</code>).</p>
<p>On the next line, we convert the type from <code>Matrix&lt;int&gt;</code> to 
  <code>Matrix&lt;float32&gt;</code> using a function from the <code>DataParallel.Conversions</code>
  module (you can find other conversion functions in the source code). Now we 
  get exactly the same result as in the earlier example that used <code>Matrix.init</code>.
  As the last step, we use the <code>pointwiseSqrt</code> function, which calculates
  square root of each element in the matrix.</p>
<p>As you can see, getting the first matrix was a bit more complicated, because
  we have a limited set of matrices to start with. We used the <code>positions</code>
  function to get matrices with coordinates as values. Other useful starting points
  are constants. The library offers numerous constant matrices such as <code>zerof</code> 
  (containing 0.0f) and others, or you can use the <code>matrixConstant</code> function.
  On the other hand, calculating square root is a bit simpler, because we have a point-wise
  function that operates over matrices. However, the most notable thing about the
  code is that we never needed to explicitly work with individual elements or 
  with coordinates. This raises the level of abstraction and hides the implementation
  of operations (which makes it possible to accelerate the code using GPU).</p>  

<h2>Implementing data-parallel rotation</h2>
<p>Now that we've seen how to write some basic operations with matrices using data-parallel
  functions, let's look at a more interesting example. In this section, we'll implement
  a simple version of rotation of an image (the rotated photo of Prague in the introduction
  was generated by this algorithm). We'll also explore some more functions from the
  <code>DataParallel</code> module. In the next section, we'll look how to run the function
  on GPU (which is also a reason why the declaration is marked with the 
  <code>ReflectedDefinition</code> attribute).</p>
<pre >
<span class="op">[</span>&lt;ReflectedDefinition&gt;<span class="op">]</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> rotateImage s c w h whalf hhalf (data:Matrix&lt;float4&gt;) =
  <span class="rem">// Initialize arrays with X and Y coordinates of a bitmap </span>
  <span class="rem">// and convert numbers to mid-image coordinates</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> posX = (Conversions.singleOfInt (positions w h 0)) -<span class="op">|</span> whalf
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> posY = (Conversions.singleOfInt (positions w h 1)) -<span class="op">|</span> hhalf
    
  <span class="rem">// Calculate rotated coordinates </span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> rotatedX = posX *<span class="op">|</span> c .- posY *<span class="op">|</span> s
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> rotatedY = posY *<span class="op">|</span> c .+ posX *<span class="op">|</span> s
  
  <span class="rem">// Convert back to corner coordinates.</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> posX = rotatedX +<span class="op">|</span> whalf
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> posY = rotatedY +<span class="op">|</span> hhalf

  <span class="rem">// Calculate X and Y indices and get values at indices  </span>
  <span class="rem">// Note: We'll implement version wiht smoothing later!</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> indX = Conversions.intOfSingle posX
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> indY = Conversions.intOfSingle posY
  gather data indX indY
</pre>
<p>We start with the matrices created by the <code>positions</code> function,
  but we immediately subtract a half of the width or height respectively. This
  way we get coordinates relatively to the center of the image. The values 
  <code>whalf</code> and <code>hhalf</code> are passed as parameters to the 
  function, because they will be calculated in advance on the CPU. Inside the
  <code>rotateImage</code> function, we perform only data-parallel operations
  on matrices, so that it can be executed on Accelerator using quotations.</p>

<p>Once we have the matrices with coordinates (<code>posX</code> and <code>posY</code>),
  we rotate the coordinates. The result will be two matrices (<code>rotatedX</code> 
  and <code>rotatedY</code>) of the same size. These matrices contain the rotated
  coordinates. This means that if we have some <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
  we can get the coordinates <code>x', y' = rotatedX.[x, y], rotatedY.[x, y]</code>.
  If we then perform a lookup into the original image <code>data.[x', y']</code>,
  we'll get the pixel at the specified <code>x, y</code> location after the rotation.</p>  
  
<p>To calculate the rotated coordinates, we use sine and cosine of the required
  angle. These two values are also calculated in advance on the CPU and are
  passed as parameters (<code>c</code> and <code>s</code>) to our function. We
  calculate the coordinates using point-wise addition and subtraction and using
  the multiplication by scalar value. After calculating the rotated values, 
  we also convert the coordinates back to the corner coordinates, so that
  we can perform the lookup in the source image (<code>data</code>).</p>
  
<p>The last block of code in the function implements the lookup. We first convert
  the rotated coordinates to exact locations (in integers). Then we use a 
  <code>gather</code> function, which is a data-parallel version of lookup
  operation. It takes a source matrix (<code>data</code>) and a pair of matrices
  with X and Y coordinates (<code>indX</code> and <code>indY</code>). For each
  position in these two matrices, it finds the value at specified location in
  the source matrix and returns it as an element of the result. If we wanted to
  write this operation in F#, we'd calculate the result for each element using
  the following equation: <code>res.[y, x] = data.[indY.[y, x], indX.[y, x]]</code>.
</p>  
<p>Understanding the code for the rotation isn't easy for the first time. You 
  can also find some useful information in the documentation for Accelerator, 
  which explains the operations like <code>gather</code> in more details. However,
  once you understand the code, you'll be surprised by its elegance.</p>
  
<h3>Running rotation on CPU</h3>
<p>Now we have the core part of the rotation algorithm. We wrote a function that
  takes some pre-computed parameters and an input image represented as a matrix
  of type <code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt;</code> and returns a rotated image of the
  same matrix type. We start by calling this function from an ordinary F# code
  running on CPU and later we'll look how to run this function using Accelerator.</p>
<p>We'll first load the input bitmap and implement a utility higher-order function that will be useful for both
  CPU and GPU versions. It takes an actual function that performs the rotation as 
  the first parameter. The second parameter and the return type are the same
  and contain the rotated image and the desired angle (<code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt; * float</code>).</p>

</pre>  
<p>We start by loading a bitmap from the application startup folder and then
  convert it to a matrix using one of the utility functions from the 
  <code>Conversions</code> module. This conversion uses a specified function
  to convert individual pixels to the target type of matrix elements, so we
  use <code>Float4.ofColor</code> to convert colors to values of type <code>float4</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>rotationStep</code> function first calculates a new angle (incremented by 1).
  Then it converts the angle to radians and pre-computes values that are passed
  to the actual rotation function (sine and cosine of the angle, half of width and 
  height of the bitmap). Once we have all the pre-computed values, we invoke
  the specified rotation function and return the result together with the new
  angle value as the new state. </p>
<p>The last step that we need to do now is to call <code>rotationStep</code>
  with the first parameter specifying the rotation function running on CPU.
  If we specify only the first parameter, we'll get a function that calculates
  a new state (bitmap and angle) from the previous step (bitmap and angle).
  We'll use a form similar to the one we used when showing the Game of Life to
  run the function iteratively and display the result after each step:
  </p>  
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> run = rotationStep (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> sn cs wid hgt widhalf hgthalf <span class="op">-&gt;</span>
  rotateImage sn cs wid hgt widhalf hgthalf data)
<span class="kwrd">let</span> toBitmap = fst &gt;&gt; Conversions.bitmapOfMatrix Float4.toColor  
DrawingForm.Run((data, 0.0), run, toBitmap)
</pre>
<p>The first parameter of the form is an initial state. The second parameter is a
  function that calculates a new state from the previous one. Finally, the last
  parameter is a function that converts the current state (<code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt; * float</code>)
  to a bitmap that can be drawn on the form. We create this function using function
  composition. We first take the first element of the tuple (a matrix) and 
  then convert it to bitmap using the <code>bitmapOfMatrix</code> function.</p>

<h2>Accelerating data-parallel F#</h2>
<p>You're probably reading this article to learn how to run computations more
  efficiently on GPU or multi-core CPU, but we're almost at the end of the article
  and I didn't write a single word on this topic! Don't be disappointed. Actually,
  all we did in the article so far was a preparation that makes running the code
  using Accelerator surprisingly easy!</p>
<p>We wrote the <code>rotateImage</code> just using functions from the <code>DataParallel</code>
  module and we marked the code using <code>ReflectedDefinition</code> attribute.
  Now we can use a translator I implemented (which is available as a source
  code download below). The translator evaluates quoted data-parallel code using
  Accelerator, so we only need to invoke it:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Accelerator
<span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Accelerator.EvalTransformation

<span class="kwrd">let</span> target = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Microsoft.ParallelArrays.DX9Target()
<span class="kwrd">let</span> processed = Accelerate.accelerate <span class="op">&lt;@@</span> rotateImage <span class="op">@@&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> runAcc =    
  rotationStep (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> sn cs wid hgt widhalf hgthalf <span class="op">-&gt;</span>
    eval&lt;Matrix&lt;float4&gt;&gt; target processed
      <span class="op">[</span> makeValue sn; makeValue cs; makeValue wid; makeValue hgt;  
        makeValue widhalf; makeValue hgthalf; makeValue data <span class="op">]</span>)

<span class="kwrd">let</span> toBitmap = fst &gt;&gt; Conversions.bitmapOfMatrix Float4.toColor
DrawingForm.Run((data, 0.0), runAcc, toBitmap)
</pre>
<p>The code is slightly more complicated than the version running on CPU, but 
  it is still very simple. We first initialize an Accelerator target (in this
  example, we'll run the code on GPU using the <code>DX9Target</code>). Then we 
  run the <code>accelerate</code> function, which is a part of the translator.
  It returns a new function which runs the function enclosed in quotations 
  using Accelerator. As I already mentioned, thanks to the <code>ReflectedDefinition</code>
  attribute, the translation function can also look inside the body of 
  <code>rotateImage</code>.</p>
<p>Once we have the accelerated function, we can use it inside the lambda function
  specified as a parameter of <code>rotationStep</code>. We cannot invoke the <code>processed</code> 
  function directly, because all the parameters and the result are encoded in some way.
  Instead, we use the generic <code>eval</code> function, which takes the desired
  type of result as a type parameter (in our case, we specify that it should return
  a value of type <code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt;</code>). The first parameter is the
  Accelerator target, the second parameter is the accelerated function to run and
  finally, the last parameter is a list of arguments to the accelerated function.
  We also need to turn all the parameters into a special value that the <code>eval</code>
  function expects, which is done using the <code>makeValue</code> function.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we've seen how to work with the F# <code>Matrix</code> type
  using data-parallel functions that duplicate the functionality available in 
  Accelerator, but work with standard F# data types. The implementation of all the 
  functions from the <code>DataParallel</code> module is a part of the project that
  translates data-parallel F# code to Accelerator using F# quotations and you can 
  get it from the list of downloads below. We've also seen a more complicated data-parallel
  calculation when we looked at implementation of an image rotation.</p>
<p>When we write a function using only primitives understood by the translator and
  when we mark the function using <code>ReflectedDefinition</code>, the translator
  can evaluate the function more efficiently using Accelerator (either using GPU
  or multi-core CPU). However, we can still run the code as a standard F# code, 
  which is very useful when testing and debugging.</p>
<p>In this article, we looked only at the simplest implementation of rotation. When 
  we used <code>gather</code> to find the location of a rotated pixel, we always
  used just the nearest neighbor. We can get better results by collecting several
  nearby pixels and interpolating the color depending on the fraction (because the
  desired location may be for example [121.3f, 35.8f]. This better version is implemented
  in the downloadable source code using the <code>interpolatef4</code> function, which
  performs a linear interpolation between <code>float4</code> values.</p>
<p>Finally, in this article we used the <code>EvalTransformation</code> module to 
  translate the code from quotations to Accelerator. We didn't discuss the translation
  architecture in details (we'll do that in the next article!). However, this module
  processes quotations and evaluates the code using Accelerator at the same time.
  This makes the source code easier to understand (the downloadable source code includes
  only this module, so it should be fairly readable). However, a more efficient approach
  is to process quotations and build a function that can be executed later. When we'd
  want to rotate the image, we'd just invoke the function and we wouldn't have to 
  analyze the code again. We'll look at this more efficient approach in the next
  article.</p>
