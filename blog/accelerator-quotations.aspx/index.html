<h1>Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/accelerator-quotations/blur.png" alt="Blurred photo of Prague" style="float:right; margin:10px" />

<p>In this article series, we're talking about the Accelerator project and I'm 
  presenting an F# library that I implemented, which allows you to use Accelerator [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-quotations.aspx#accelfsh4links">references</a>]
  in a more sophisticated way. We've seen two examples of using Accelerator directly
  (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">introduction</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Game of Life</a>).
  In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">previous article</a>
  I introduced my F# library for working with Accelerator. We've seen F# functions from the
  <code>DataParallel</code> module, we implemented an algorithm that rotates an image
  using these functions and finally, we've seen that we can take this ordinary F# code
  and run it using Accelerator. This is all possible thanks to F# quotations, which 
  we can use to get an AST (a source code) of an F# function we wrote (if the function
  is marked in some special way).</p>
  
<p>In this part of the series, we're going to look at working with quotations explicitly.
  We'll use meta-programming techniques to work with Accelerator. Meta-programming means
  writing programs that manipulate with other programs or pieces of code. This is exactly
  what we're going to do in this article. We'll write an F# function (running on CPU) that
  builds a program, which we'll then run using Accelerator.</p>
<p>This is quite interesting approach, which isn't possible when we call Accelerator
  methods as standard F# functions or .NET methods. The benefit is that we'll 
  clearly see which parts of program run on CPU and what parts execute on GPU or using
  X64 multi-core target. We could also perform more complicated optimizations with 
  the code (because this wouldn't affect the readability). Just for your reference, here is the list
  of articles in this series in case you missed some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">Accelerator and F# (I.): Introduction and calculating PI</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-life-game.aspx">Accelerator and F# (II.): The Game of Life on GPU</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx">Accelerator and F# (III.): Data-parallel programs using F# quotations</a></li>
  <li><strong>Accelerator and F# (IV.): Composing computations with quotations</strong></li>
</ul>  
<p>However, enough with theory and let's take a look at some code samples! 
  This time, we'll implement blurring of an image (also called convolution). 
  Another example how to write this in F# using Accelerator is Satnam Singh's blog 
  post [<a href="#accelfsh4links">4</a>]. Our example will be different, because we'll
  write the code as standard F# program and then have it translated to Accelerator
  automatically using quotations. We'll also talk about the architecture
  of the library that we're using and look at some performance results.</p>

<h2>Blurring an image</h2>
<p>To blur an image, we'll shift the image in both X and Y directions with 
  some specified offsets. This way, we'll get a multiple copies of the same
  image shifted in various directions. We'll calculate weighted average of 
  all the images. This means that the bigger the offset will be, the less 
  importance we'll give to the copy. We'll start by referencing several
  namespaces, including F# <code>Math</code> namespace from PowerPack.dll
  and <code>Quotations</code> namespace for working with F# quotations.
  We also reference several namespaces from my library for translating
  data-parallel F# code to Accelerator code.</p>

<pre >
<span class="rem">// Reference F# libraries</span>
<span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Math
<span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations
<span class="kwrd">module</span> Matrix = Math.Matrix.Generic

<span class="rem">// Quotations translator &amp; float4</span>
<span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Math
<span class="kwrd">open</span> FSharp.Accelerator
</pre>

<p>Now that we have the references, we can start implementing the actual 
  blur. We'll start by calculating a <em>kernel</em>, which is an array with
  coefficients that we'll use when composing shifted images.</p>

<h3>Calculating kernel</h3>
<p>We'll use an algorithm that's based on a sample that ships with Accelerator
  and is called Gaussian filter. This means that for an offset <em>j</em>,
  the value in the kernel will be <em>exp(j<sup>2</sup> / 2&#963;<sup>2</sup>)</em>
  for some constant <em>&#963;</em>. Then we'll also normalize the kernel, 
  to make sure that the values add up to 1.</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Compute kernel for the blur algorithm</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> computeCoefficients size =
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> halfSize = size / 2
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> gauss = List.init size (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> i <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 
    Math.Exp(-float((i - halfSize) * (i - halfSize)) / 8.0))
    
  <span class="rem">// Normalize values and convert them to 'float4'</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> sum = List.sum gauss
  <span class="op">[</span> <span class="kwrd">for</span> v <span class="kwrd">in</span> ia <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Float4.ofSingle(float32(v / sum)) <span class="op">]</span>
</pre>
<p>Inside the body of the function, we first initialize a list with 
  values of the Gaussian function using <code>List.init</code>. To normalize
  the values, we simply sum all values using <code>List.sum</code> and then
  divide each element of the kernel by the sum. This is written using a simple
  list-comprehension. Note that we also convert the result to a value of 
  <code>float4</code> type, because we'll use it with a type representing 
  an image (just like in the previous article, this type will be 
  <code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt;</code>). </p>

<h3>Variables inside quotations</h3>
<p>First of all, we'll need one more utility function. The <code>makeBlurImage</code>
  function will construct an expression that represents F# code, which performs
  blurring of an image. We'll need to use a few variables inside the generated
  expression. To create variables inside generated F# quotation, we'll use the 
  following utility:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> variable&lt;'TResult&gt; name = 
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> var = Var.Global(name, typeof&lt;'TResult&gt;)
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> expr = Expr.Cast&lt;'TResult&gt;(Expr.Var(var))
  var, expr
</pre>
<p>This function creates a new variable of type <code>'TResult</code> with a 
  name <code>name</code>. It returns a tuple <code>Var * Expr&lt;'TResult&gt;</code>.
  The first element of a tuple is an object that represents the variable.
  The second element is a typed F# quotation that represents code that reads
  the value of the variable. The quotation is typed, which means that it 
  carries the type of the expression as a type parameter. In this case, the
  type of the expression is obviously the same as the type of the variable
  (<code>'TResult</code>).</p>

<h3>Implementing the blur filter</h3>
<p>Now that we have a utility function for working with variables inside
  quotations, let's look at the <code>makeBlurImage</code> function. The implementation
  requires more explanation, so we'll split it between three listings.
  We'll look only at the body, because the declaration is quite simple.
  The function takes only a single parameter named <code>kernel</code>, 
  which is a list of <code>float4</code> values representing coefficients
  used for blurring. Now, let's take a look at the first part of the function:</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Compute kernel with offsets  </span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> half = kernel.Length / 2
<span class="kwrd">let</span> indices = <span class="op">[</span>-half .. kernel.Length-half-1]
<span class="kwrd">let</span> kernel = List.zip kernel indices
<span class="rem">// Parameter of the returned function</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> inputVar, inputExpr = variable&lt;Matrix&lt;float4&gt;&gt; <span class="str">"input"</span>
</pre>
<p>We start by adding zipping the kernel with indices that represent
  offset used when shifting the image. For example, if we received a 
  kernel containing 3 values such as <code>[0.2; 0.6; 0.2]</code>, we'd
  join it with indices <code>[-1; 0; 1]</code>. The result would be
  <code>[(0.2, -1); (0.6, 0); (0.2, 1)]</code>. We'll use this list
  shortly. We'll create a multiple copies of the image, shift it by
  the offset specified as the second element of the tuple and multiply it by
  the value specified as the first element to get a couple of images that 
  add up to a single blurred image. </p>
<p>The last line of the code creates a variable named <code>input</code>.
  We'll use it as an input parameter of a quoted function that we'll construct.
  You can imagine as if we were writing something like <code>&lt;@ fun input -&gt; ... @&gt;</code>.
  Now, let's take a look at the code that generates the <code>...</code> 
  part of the expression.</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Compose convolution in X direction</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> initial = <span class="op">&lt;@</span> zerof4 (%inputExpr).Dimensions <span class="op">@&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> convolvedX = 
  kernel <span class="op">|</span>&gt; List.fold (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> st (v, idx) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 
  <span class="op">&lt;@</span> (%st) .+ (shift (%inputExpr) 0 idx) *<span class="op">|</span> v <span class="op">@&gt;</span>) initial 
</pre>
<p>This bit of code is far more interesting. It starts by declaring a 
  value <code>initial</code>. The initialization expression is a quotation
  that calls the <code>zerof4</code> function to initialize a matrix filled
  with zeros. The function takes dimensions as an argument and we give it 
  dimensions of the input matrix as the argument. We invoke the <code>Dimensions</code>
  property on an expression <code>(%inputExpr)</code>. This construct is
  called <em>a splice</em> and it means that we're embedding another quotation
  inside the quotation we're currently writing. We created <code>inputExpr</code>
  earlier as a quotation that represents reading of the input variable. Here,
  we splice it into a larger quotation that gets a property of this variable and
  then uses the result as an argument of some function. </p>
<p>The idea of splicing is very important and we'll need it a couple of times
  in this article, so let me show you one more example. Let's say we declared
  a value <code>added = &lt;@ 2 + 3 @&gt;</code>. Now, we can use the 
  splicing operator <code>%</code> to insert the quotation into another, larger 
  quotation: <code>&lt;@ (%added) * (%added) &gt;</code>. If you now examine the
  result, you'll see that we created a quotation <code>&lt;@ (2+3) * (2+3) @&gt;</code>.</p>  
<p>Once we have the <code>initial</code> value representing an empty image, 
  we use the <code>fold</code> function to construct more complicated quotation
  based on the <code>kernel</code> value. In each step, we create a quotation that
  takes the previous one <code>(%st)</code> and adds it with a value calculated 
  by <code>(shift (%inputExpr) 0 idx) *| v</code>. This represents the input
  image <code>(%inputExpr)</code> shifted by <code>idx</code> in the second coordinate
  and finally, multiplied by the coefficient <code>v</code>, which comes
  from the kernel. If we evaluated the function so far and looked at the generated 
  quotation, the result would look like this (except, we didn't yet join
  the body with the parameter declaration into a function):</p>  
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">fun</span> input <span class="op">-&gt;</span>
  (zerof4 input.Dimensions)   .+ ((shift input 0 -1) *<span class="op">|</span> 0.2f) .+
  ((shift input 0 0) *<span class="op">|</span> 0.6f) .+ ((shift input 0 1) *<span class="op">|</span> 0.2f)
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we've just performed a convolution by the second coordinate.
  Now, we'll do a very similar thing using the first coordinate. Instead of 
  just blindly replicating the above displayed generated code 3 times, we'll
  store the result in a new variable named <code>convolvedX</code> and
  then blur this partially blurred image by the second coordinate.</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Store the convolved result in a variable</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> convXVar, convXExpr = variable&lt;Matrix&lt;float4&gt;&gt; <span class="str">"convolvedX"</span>

<span class="rem">// Compose convolution in Y direction</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> body = kernel <span class="op">|</span>&gt; List.fold (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> st (v, idy) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 
  <span class="op">&lt;@</span> (%st) .+ (shift (%convXExpr) idy 0) *<span class="op">|</span> v <span class="op">@&gt;</span>) initial 

<span class="kwrd">let</span> convXDecl = Expr.Let(convXVar, convolvedX, body)
Expr.Lambda(inputVar, convXDecl)
</pre>
<p>We start by declaring a new variable named <code>convolvedX</code> which we'll
  use to store the result of the computation we wrote so far. The middle part of the
  listing is very similar to the previous one. We again generate a quotation that
  adds the initial (empty) image with a series of images shifted by a specific offset
  and multiplied by a value specified by the kernel. Note that the image we use as 
  a parameter to the <code>shift</code> function is the one stored in the <code>convolvedX</code>
  variable, because the argument of the splicing operator is an expression that represents
  reading of its value <code>(%convXExpr)</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last two lines, we create a quotation that joins everything we wrote
  so far together. The first line declares a value binding that declares the 
  <code>convolvedX</code> variable and the second line builds a lambda function that we
  return as the result. The generated quotation looks like this: <code>(fun input -&gt; 
  let convolvedX = <em>comp<sub>1</sub></em> in <em>comp<sub>2</sub></em>)</code>. The
  first placeholder represents a computation that we constructed in the preceding 
  listing and the second placeholder represents the code we constructed now.</p>

<p>Composing data-parallel code using F# quotations as we've seen in this section
  isn't easy to understand if you're not already familiar with meta-programming techniques.
  The important point that you need to realize is that we're writing code that 
  constructs some other code. In our case, we're writing code that runs on CPU and that
  constructs data-parallel program, which will run using Accelerator. However, the 
  nice thing about this approach is that you can clearly see which part of the
  code runs now (e.g. both of the folds) and which will run later (shifting and
  point-wise addition of matrices inside the quoted code).</p>

<h3>Running blur filter</h3>
<p>We now have a function that builds a quoted code that implements the blur filter
  and can be translated to Accelerator calls. The last step is to run the function
  and give the resulting code to a library that actually performs the blur (we'll
  use the <code>DX9Target</code>, which will perform the data-parallel operations
  on GPU).</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">do</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> target = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Microsoft.ParallelArrays.DX9Target()
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> bmp = Bitmap.FromFile(Application.StartupPath+<span class="str">"\\prague.jpg"</span>) :?&gt; Bitmap 
         <span class="op">|</span>&gt; Conversions.matrixOfBitmap Float4.ofColor
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> coefs = computeCoefficients 10
  
  <span class="rem">// Accelerated version of blur</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> accelerated = Accelerate.accelerate (makeBlurImage coefs)
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> run data = 
    eval&lt;Matrix&lt;float4&gt;&gt; 
      target accelerated <span class="op">[</span> makeValue data <span class="op">]</span>
  
  DrawingForm.Run(bmp, run, Conversions.bitmapOfMatrix Float4.toColor)
</pre>
<p>The listing first initializes Accelerator <em>target</em> and then loads a bitmap
  from the startup path of the application. We immediately convert the bitmap to 
  a type <code>Matrix&lt;float4&gt;</code>, which we'll use as an input to our
  data-parallel blur. Once we have the input, we construct a function 
  <code>run</code>, which takes a bitmap (represented as a matrix), blurs it and
  returns the result (again, as a matrix). To do this, we first invoke 
  <code>makeBlurImage</code> with a kernel as an argument. The result of this call
  is a quotation of a function performing the blur filter. We pass the quotation
  to the <code>accelerate</code> function, which analyzes it and gives us a function
  which performs the data-parallel blur using Accelerator.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>run</code> function, we use <code>eval</code> to invoke the
  accelerated function. We give it a <em>target</em> to use for evaluating data-parallel
  operations and we wrap the single argument into a <code>TransformValue</code> using
  the <code>makeValue</code> function (as described in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx"
  type="external">previous article</a>). As the last step, we run the application
  using the <code>DrawingForm</code> object. It takes the initial state as the first
  argument, a function that calculates the next state as the second argument and
  a function that converts the state (a matrix) into a bitmap as the last argument.</p>  

<h2>Architecture &amp; Performance</h2>
<p>Before we conclude, let's take a look at the overall architecture of the application
  we just implemented (including the components from Accelerator and components from
  my F# library for using Accelerator). I also made some measurements, so we'll take a
  look at some performance results.</p>
<img src="/articles/accelerator-quotations/architecture.png" alt="Application architecture" style="float:right; margin:10px;" />
<h3>Understanding architecture</h3>
<p>You can see a diagram showing the architecture on the right. The dashed arrows
  represent references or uses of some other component. For example, the user program 
  we generated uses operations from the <code>DataParallel</code> module. 
  Solid arrows represent some data-flow. For example, the User Program is passed
  as an input to the <code>Accelerate</code> component, which produces an 
  Accelerated Program as the result.</p>
<p>There are several components, so let me start by discussing them one-by-one. 
  The violet components come from my F# library (if you download the source code,
  you'll see it as FSharp.Math.Accelerator.dll). The orange boxes represent components
  from Microsoft Research Accelerator library. Let's start by discussing the violet
  boxes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DataParallel</strong> contains operations for working with matrices 
    that can be easily translated to Accelerator calls (such as the <code>shift</code>
    function and the <code>+.</code> operator). We discussed more functions from this
    module in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-dataparallel.aspx"
    type="external">previous article</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Accelerate</strong> implements an analysis of quoted F# programs that
    implement algorithms using functions from the <code>DataParallel</code> module.
    During the analysis, it composes an accelerated program (which performs the same
    operation using Accelerator) as the result. To compose the program, it can use
    one of two modules that provide slightly different behavior (<code>EvalTransformation</code>
    or <code>CompileTransformation</code>).</li>    
  <li><strong>EvalTransformation</strong> evaluates the program during analysis of
    F# quotations (after it receives input data). This means that the analysis of
    quotations is done once for each call to the Accelerated Program. This is less 
    efficient, but it makes debugging easier.</li>
  <li><strong>CompileTransformation</strong> is more efficient. It analyzes quotations 
    only once and builds a function as the result. This means that when we later run the 
    Accelerated Program, it doesn't need to analyze quotations again. It immediately
    runs the algorithm we implemented using Accelerator.</li>    
</ul>
<p>Once we get the Accelerated Program using the <code>Accelerate.accelerate</code> function,
  we need to give it some input data as an argument and it produces some output. Depending
  on the Transformation component we used, this may or may not need to analyze F# quotations
  internally. However, that's not visible from the outside. Aside from the input data,
  we also need to specify which Accelerator <em>target</em> should be used when
  evaluating the program. This can be one of the orange boxes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DX9Target</strong> performs data-parallel operations using
    shaders on your GPU. This is massively parallel, however there are some initial
    costs associated with copying data to the GPU memory and back.</li>    
  <li><strong>X64MultiCore</strong> performs data-parallel operations using
    multi-core 64bit CPU. This is using highly optimized native implementation.</li>
</ul>  
<p>If you want to use the library to run your computations with the F# 
  <code>Matrix</code> type more efficiently, you'll always use the <code>CompileTransform</code>
  (this is specified using a compilation symbol in the downloadable source code
  and it is turned on by default). Then you can choose either GPU or multi-core execution
  depending on your machine.</p>

<h3>Measuring the performance</h3>
<p>I did some experiments on my dual-core (Intel Core 2 Duo P8400, 2.26GHz) laptop with 
  an integrated graphics card (Intel GMA 4500MHD), so let's look at the results.
  Because I'm using only an integrated GPU, the numbers are better for the native 
  multi-core implementation, but I suspect that a better GPU would give more interesting
  results (please drop me a note in the comments with your results if you get 
  some interesting numbers!)</p>

</table>

<p>Even though I run the tests on a usual laptop, some of the results are
  quite impressive! I implemented all the tests that we've seen in the article series so far,
  so we have a Pi calculation using Monte-Carlo method, Conway's Game of Life and two
  graphical filters (rotation and blur). For some reason, the rotation doesn't work when
  executed with the <code>X64MultiCoreTarget</code> (I suspect this is a bug in the current
  version of Accelerator). The most significant performance improvement can be seen in the
  Blur filter, which runs almost 40 times faster compared to the naive code using F# <code>Matrix</code>.</p>
<p>I run the tests using <code>CompileTransformation</code>, so each test spent some 
  time while pre-processing the F# quotations and building the accelerated function that
  we use later. This is needed only once and can be performed in advance, so it isn't a 
  problem in practice. You can see these times in the Preprocessing column.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this series, we talked about the MSR Accelerator project and how to use it from 
  F#. In the first two articles, we used it directly. This way, we work with special
  types provided by the Accelerator library and we write computations using methods
  that these types offer. This is quite easy, but we have to use different types and
  we can't debug the code easily (because everything runs at the end of the algorithm
  using GPU).</p>
<p>In the previous and this article, I introduced a library that I created (originally, 
  during an internship at MSR about two and a half years ago)! Since then, both F# and 
  Accelerator become available in a new version, so I updated the library using the latest
  technologies. As we've seen, the library allows you to write code using the standard
  F# <code>Matrix</code> type and then translates it automatically (using F# quotations)
  to function that runs more efficiently using Accelerator. In the previous article,
  we've seen that we can write data-parallel functions as normal functions and mark
  them using the <code>ReflectedDefinition</code> attribute.</p>
<p>In this article, we've seen a more sophisticated technique. We used meta-programming
  techniques to write a function (running on CPU) that produces a quoted function
  (which can be executed using Accelerator). This way, you could easily see which part
  of the code runs when, which is not easy when using Accelerator directly. In the end,
  we also looked at some performance results that compare a naive code written using
  <code>Matrix</code> type with a version optimized using the library I described.</p>

<p>For now, this is the last article of the series, but please let me know if there
  is something you'd be interested in more details! In the future, I'd also like to 
  implement one more extension to this library, which would allow you to write the 
  matrix processing code in a more readable way then when using data-parallel functions
  explicitly, so if you liked the series, stay tuned for more articles!</p>
