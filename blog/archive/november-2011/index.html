  <h1><a href="http://test.tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-generic-numeric.aspx/index.html">F# Math (IV.) - Writing generic numeric code</a></h1>
  <p>Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as <code>int</code>, <code>decimal</code> and <code>float</code> or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series</a>). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the <code>'a list</code> type or <code>List.map</code> function, because <em>numeric code</em> uses numeric operators 
  such as <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> that are defined differently for each numeric type.</p>

<p>When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter <code>'T</code>, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Static member constraints</strong> can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as <code>List.sum</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Global numeric associations</strong> (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>).</li>

  <li><strong>Combination of both</strong> techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.

  <h1><a href="http://test.tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx/index.html">F# Math (III.) - Defining custom numeric types</a></h1>
  <p>In this article, we define an F# numeric type for calculating in the modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic)
  [<a href="#ppcnuml">1</a>].  
  Modular arithmetic is used for calculations where we want to keep a value within a specified range by counting in cycles. 
  For example, a maximal value on clock is 12 hours. When we add 11 hours and 3 hours, the value overflows and the result is 
  2 hours. Aside from clocks, this numeric system is also essential in cryptography or, for example, in music.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows several techniques that are essential when defining any new numeric type in F#. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a numeric type with overloaded operators </li>
<li>Define a numeric literal for constructing numbers of our new type</li>
<li>Enable calculating with our type in F# lists and matrices</li>
<li>Hide implementation details of a numeric type</li>
</ul>

<p>We define type <code>IntegerZ5</code> that implements modular arithmetic with modulus 5, meaning that valid values are in the range 
  from 0 to 4 and we equip the type with operations such as addition and multiplication. When an operation produces a value that would 
  be outside of the range, we adjust it by adding or subtracting the modulus (in our case 5). Here are some examples of calculations 
  that we’ll be able to write:</p>
<pre>
2 + 1 = 3 (mod 5)
4 * 2 = 3 (mod 5)
List.sum [ 0; 1; 2; 3 ] = 1 (mod 5)
</pre>

<p>In the first case, we can perform the operation without any adjustments. In the second case, we multiply 4 by 2 and get 8 as the 
  result, which is out of the required range. To correct it, we calculate the remainder after a division by 5 (written as <code>8 % 5</code> in F#), 
  which gives us 3. Finally, the last example shows that we’d also like to be able to use our type with lists. If we add values 0, 1, 2
  and 3, we get 6 which is adjusted to 1.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://test.tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-matrix.aspx/index.html">F# Math (II.) - Using matrices for graph algorithms</a></h1>
   <p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx">previous article of this 
  series</a>, we looked at <code>complex</code> and <code>BigRational</code>, which are two 
  numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. Aside from these two, the PowerPack 
  library also contains a type <code>matrix</code> representing a two-dimensional matrix
  of floating-point values.</p>

<p>In this article, you'll learn how to work with matrices in F#, using some 
  of the functions provided by F# PowerPack. I'll demonstrate the library using an 
  example that represents <em>graphs</em> using a, so called, <em>adjacency matrix</em>.
  If you're not familiar with this concept, you don't need to worry. It is quite simple
  and it will be clear once we look at an example.
  The matrix represents which vertices of a graph are connected with other vertices by 
  an edge. Many of the standard operations on matrices are useful when working with 
  adjacency matrix, so this tutorial will cover the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating matrices from lists and using functions from the <code>Matrix</code> module</li>
  <li>Using slices to read or modify a part of matrix</li>
  <li>Performing standard operations with matrices such as transposition and matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Using higher order functions for working with matrices</li>
</ul>

  <h1><a href="http://test.tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx/index.html">F# Math (I.) - Numeric types in PowerPack</a></h1>
  <p>In this article, we'll briefly look at two numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. 
  The type <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers consisting of real and imaginary parts. 
  Both parts are stored as a floating point numbers. The type <code>BigRational</code> represents 
  rational numbers consisting of numerator and denominator of arbitrary sizes. Integers of arbitrary
  size are represented using <code>BigInteger</code> type that is available in .NET 4.0 
  (in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly). On .NET 2.0, the <code>BigInteger</code>
  type is also a part of F# PowerPack.</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/powerpack-series/z5snip.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 5px 15px" />
<p>This article is the first article of a series where I'll explain some of the
  F# features that are useful for numeric computing as well as some functionality from 
  the F# PowerPack library. Most of the content was originally written for 
  the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx">Numerical Computing in F#</a> chapter on MSDN (that I 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">announced earlier</a>), 
  but then we decided to focus on using F# with third party libraries that provide more
  efficient implementation and richer set of standard numeric functionality that's 
  needed when implementing machine learning and probabilistic algorithms or performing 
  statistical analysis. If you're interested in these topics, then the last section 
  (below) gives links to the important MSDN articles.</p>

<p>However, F# PowerPack still contains some useful functionality. It includes two
  additional numeric types and an implementation of matrix that integrates nicely
  with F#. The series also demonstrates how to use features of the F# language 
  (and core libraries) to write numeric code elegantly. In particular, we'll use the
  following aspects:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Overloaded operators.</strong> Any type can provide overloaded version of standard numeric 
    operators such as +, -, * and / as well as other non-standard operators (such as .*). 
    As a result, libraries can implement their own numeric types which are 
    indistinguishable from built-in types such as int.</li>

  <li><strong>Numeric literals.</strong> F# math libraries can enable using new numeric literals in the code. For example, you can 
    write a <code>BigRational</code> value representing one third as <code>1N/3N</code>. The <code>N</code> suffix used in the 
    notation is not hardcoded in the F# language and we'll see how to define similar 
    numeric type.</li>

  <li><strong>Static constraints.</strong> F# supports static member constraints, which can be used for writing functions that 
    work with any numeric type. For example, the <code>List.sum</code> function uses this feature. It 
    can sum elements of any list containing numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just a few of the F# language features that are useful when writing numeric code, but
there are many others. The usual F# development style using interactive tools, type safety that
prevents common errors, units of measure as well the expressivity of F# make it a great tool for
writing numeric code. For more information, take a look at the MSDN overview article 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304366.aspx">Writing Succinct and Correct Numerical Computations with F#</a>.
