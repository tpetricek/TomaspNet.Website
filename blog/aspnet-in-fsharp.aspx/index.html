<h1>F# Support for ASP.NET and Notes on Samples</h1>
<div class="note">
<h3>More recent article available</h3>
This article is no longer up-to-date. Although the techniques described in the article might still work (with minor adjustments to the newer version of F#), it is now recommended to use a different approach. Also, the samples discussed in the article are not currently available. For more recent information see:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-mvc-web.aspx">ASP.NET and F# (I.) - Creating MVC web applications in F#</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I spent three months as an intern in Microsoft Research in Cambridge last year 
  and I was working with Don Syme and James Margetson from the F# team. Most of the time I was working
  on the F# Web Toolkit, which I introduced on the blog some time ago [<a href="#myfsstuff">1</a>],
  but I also worked on a few additions that are now part of the F# release. Probably the most useful addition is 
  a new implementation of the CodeDOM provider for the F# language which makes it possible to use ASP.NET
  smoothly from F# (but it can be used in some other scenarios as well) together with two ASP.NET sample
  applications that you can explore and use as a basis for your web sites. This was actually a part of the
  distribution for a few months now (I of course wanted to write this article much earlier...), so you may 
  have already noticed, but anyway, I'd still like to write down a short description of these ASP.NET samples
  and also a few tips for those who're interested in writing web applications in F#.
  </p>

<h2>F# and ASP.NET</h2>
<p>Let's start by looking at the ASP.NET examples. You can find them in the <code>samples</code> directory
  in your F# installation under the <code>Web/ASP.NET</code> path. The directory also contains <code>html</code>
  files with description of the projects and a guide to configuring them, but I'll describe both of these topics
  in this post. The distribution contains two sample projects: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AspNetIntro</strong> - this project is (almost) the simples possible F# web site, so it 
    can be used as a template for your web sites. It shows how to configure the CodeDOM provider, how to
    write a simple page with code-behind and how to use the <code>App_Code</code> directory and data-binding. </li>
  <li><strong>PersonalWebSite</strong> - this is a more complex web site ported from the C# sample called <strong>Personal 
    Web Site Starter Kit</strong> [<a href="#myfsstuff">2</a>]. It demonstrates many of the standard ASP.NET 2.0 techniques
    including data access controls, master pages, membership and custom HTTP handlers.</li>
</ul>  

<h2>ASP.NET Introduction using F#</h2>
<p>To start playing with ASP.NET you'll need to open the project (I recommend copying it to your working directory first).
  If you're using Visual Studio, you can select <code>File - Open - Web Site...</code> in the menu and select the directory with
  your project as demonstrated at Figure 1 below. The organization of ASP.NET projects is different than organization of ordinary 
  F# projects - in ASP.NET the project is just a directory and it contains all the files in the directory (this is also the reason 
  why you have to open it using a different command). The Figure 2 shows how the files of the ASP.NET Introduction project are 
  organized in the Solution Explorer:
</p>

<div>
  <div style="width:650px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
  <div style="float:left; text-align:center; margin:10px;">
    <a href="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/openweb.png" target="_blank"><img src="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/openweb_sm.png" alt="Open Web Site in Visual Studio" style="border:0px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></a><br />
    <small>Figure 1: Open Web Site</small>
  </div>
  <div style="float:left; text-align:center; margin:10px;">
    <img src="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/solutionexp.png" alt="Solution Explorer" /><br />
    <small>Figure 2: Solution Explorer</small>
  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div></div>

<p>As you can see, there are 6 files in the project. The <code>Default.aspx.fs</code> and <code>Default.aspx</code> together
  form one web page and the <code>DataBinding.aspx.fs</code> with <code>DataBinding.aspx</code> form the second web page. 
  The <code>App_Code</code> directory contains application logic that can be used from other pages in the project and in
  our sample project it contains only one file (<code>logic.fs</code>).
  Finally, the <code>web.config</code> file contains configuration of the whole application.</p>
  
<p>Before we look at the pages you may want to check the <code>web.config</code> file, because it needs to contain the correct 
  reference to the CodeDOM provider implementation including a version of the current F# installation.
  At the time of writing this article, the latest version is <code>1.9.3.14</code>, but if you're not sure what version
  you are using, you can just start the <code>fsi.exe</code> from the F# installation which prints the version number. The <code>web.config</code> file
  is an <code>xml</code> file and it should contain the following content (with the right version number). The samples in the
  distribution should contain the correct version number, but the incorrect configuration is a common issue when working
  with ASP.NET in F#, so it is useful to know what the configuration should look like:</p>  

<pre >
<span class="asp">&lt;?</span>xml version=<span class="str">"1.0"</span><span class="asp">?&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="html">system.web</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

      <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">="Microsoft.FSharp.Compiler.CodeDom.FSharpAspNetCodeProvider,

            Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=a19089b1c74d0809"<span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">compilers</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">compilation</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="html">system.web</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>Now, let's look at the <code>Default.aspx</code> and <code>Default.aspx.fs</code> files that together represent a simple page.
  The page contains one button and one label (a control that can display some text) and when the user clicks on the button, the
  result of some calculation is displayed in the label (the calculation is executed on the server-side). The following code is 
  a (slightly simplified) content of the <code>Default.aspx</code>
  file, which defines the HTML markup together with the ASP.NET controls that are on the page:</p>  
<pre >
<span class="asp">&lt;%@ Page Language="F#" 
  CodeFile="Default.aspx.fs" Inherits="FSharpWeb.Default" %&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">html</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">body</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="html">form</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:Button</span> 
    <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="btnTest"</span> <span class="attr">RunAt</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="attr">Text</span><span class="kwrd">="Click me!"</span> 
    <span class="attr">OnClick</span><span class="kwrd">="ButtonClicked"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="html">br</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:Label</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="lblResult"</span> <span class="attr">RunAt</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">form</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="html">body</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">html</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>You can easily identify two server-side controls, because these are written using prefix <code>asp</code> and
  also contain the <code>RunAt="server"</code> attribute, which means that the control is processed on the server-side.
  You can use standard HTML notation for setting attributes of the controls. We set the <code>ID</code> attribute
  to both of the controls, which is important because it allows us to use them in the code-behind code. The <code>OnClick</code>
  attribute of the button sets an event handler - a member of the <code>FSharpWeb.Default</code> type from the code-behind file that 
  will be called on the server-side, when a user clicks on the button (which submits the HTML form and causes a page reload, 
  so the event can be processed on the server). The file also contains the first special line, which tells the ASP.NET engine that the 
  page is written in F# and it also tells what source file contains the code-behind code and what is the name of type declared in that file.
  The code-behind file (<code>Default.aspx.fs</code>) has the following content:</p>
<pre >
<span class="preproc">#light</span>
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> FSharpWeb
<span class="kwrd">open</span> System
<span class="kwrd">open</span> System.Web
<span class="kwrd">open</span> System.Web.UI.WebControls

<span class="kwrd">type</span> Default() =
  <span class="kwrd">inherit</span> Page()
  
  <span class="op">[</span>&lt;DefaultValue&gt;<span class="op">]</span>
  <span class="kwrd">val</span> <span class="kwrd">mutable</span> btnTest : Button

  <span class="op">[</span>&lt;DefaultValue&gt;<span class="op">]</span>
  <span class="kwrd">val</span> <span class="kwrd">mutable</span> lblResult : Label

  <span class="kwrd">member</span> this.ButtonClicked(sender, e) =
    this.lblResult.Text <span class="op">&lt;-</span> 
      (sprintf <span class="str">"Factorial of 5 is: %d"</span> 
               (FSharpWeb.Logic.factorial 5))
</pre>
<p>As we can see, the file contains an F# object type (named <code>Default</code>), inherited from the base ASP.NET <code>Page</code>
  type. Thanks to the recent improvements in F# it is possible to write the type using the new implicit class syntax (note the parentheses
  after the type name), which means that you can place additional initialization code to the type declaration directly (following
  the <code>inherit</code> clause and F# will treat this as a constructor.</p>
<p>  
  The class contains a mutable field for every control declared in the declarative markup with the name same as the <code>ID</code>
  attribute in the markup file (<code>btnTest</code> and <code>lblResult</code>). The ASP.NET initializes these controls automatically
  when it creates the page (that's why the fields are marked using <code>mutable</code>), so we don't need to initialize these fields 
  in our code - F# doesn't usually allow uninitialized fields, but if you place the <code>DefaultValue</code> before the field declaration,
  it will be initialized to the default value (<code>null</code>), which is correct, because the field will be later initialized by the 
  ASP.NET runtime. Finally, the type contains a member called <code>ButtonClicked</code>, which is a 
  same name we used in the markup for the <code>OnClick</code> attribute of the button control. This is an
  event handler that will be called when user clicks on the button, it performs some calculation (the <code>factorial</code>
  function is declared in the <code>logic.fs</code> file) and sets a property of the other control that we have on the page. </p>

<h2>Personal Web Site in F#</h2>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px;text-align:center;">
  <a href="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/pws.png" target="_blank"><img src="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/pws_sm.png" alt="Personal Web Site" style="border:0px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></a><br />
  <small>Figure 3: Personal Web Site</small>
</div>
<p>The second sample ASP.NET project is a port of quite a complex ASP.NET web site which also uses MS SQL database. The database
  can be created manually as described in <code>Welcome.html</code> in the <code>PersonalWebSite</code> directory, but I also
  uploaded the database to my web, so you can just download it and attach it in the SQL server (this is described below and the files for download 
  can be found at the end of the article). 
  The <code>PWS_AspNetDb</code> is a database managed by ASP.NET that contains user information - the database below already contains
  the required role (called <code>Administrators</code>) and one user (<code>admin</code> with password <code>admin123!</code>).
  The second database file (<code>PWS_WebPersonal</code>) contains the application data, mainly information about photos and galleries
  (as you can see from the screenshot in Figure 3). </p>
<p>The application uses many advanced ASP.NET features including the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master Pages</strong> - the overall structure of the web site is stored in a master page
    (<code>Default.master</code>) and the other pages use the <code>asp:Content</code> control to fill 
    the place holders in the master page.</li>
  <li><strong>Site Maps</strong> - the map of the web site is defined in the <code>web.sitemap</code> file and
    is used for generating the menu in the <code>Default.master</code> file.</li>
  <li><strong>Themes</strong> - the design of the page including CSS files and images are managed using
    ASP.NET Themes - there are two standard themes in the <code>App_Themes</code> directory.</li>    
  <li><strong>Membership</strong> - the web uses standard ASP.NET technology for managing user accounts
    including the controls for manipulating with users (e.g. <code>asp:CreateUserWizard</code> control is used in 
    <code>Register.aspx</code> file).</li>    
  <li><strong>Data Controls</strong> - ASP.NET data-access controls are used for reading the 
    data from the application logic layer (implemented as a module in F#)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the databases</h3>
<p>To configure the databases required by the demo, you can either follow the steps described in the <a href="/articles/aspnet-in-fsharp/Welcome.html">Welcome.html</a>
  file (which is part of the sample project), or if you already have some version of SQL Server installed on your machine, you can download
  the sample databases below (a bunch of MDF and LDF files) and attach them to the SQL Server. I'll explain how to do this using full version
  of SQL Server, but the steps needed with Express edition are very similar.</p>
<p>Once you downloaded the files, you'll need to launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the server instance. After doing
  that you should see an "Object Explorer" window, where you can right click on the "Databases" group and select "Attach..." from the pop-up menu.
  In the opened dialog window, you can add the databases (by selecting the MDF file) and click the "OK" button to attach the databases.
  Finally, you'll need to modify the <code>web.config</code> file in the Personal WebSite sample to include the following section:
</p>  
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">connectionStrings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
 <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="Personal"</span> <span class="attr">providerName</span><span class="kwrd">="System.Data.SqlClient"</span> <span class="attr">connectionString</span>=
      <span class="kwrd">"Data Source=.;Integrated Security=True;Database=PWS_WebPersonal"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
 <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">remove</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="LocalSqlServer"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
 <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="LocalSqlServer"</span> <span class="attr">connectionString</span>=
      <span class="kwrd">"Data Source=.;Integrated Security=True;Database=PWS_AspNetDb"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">connectionStrings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>The <code>Data Source</code> parameter in the connection string specifies the instance of the SQL Server, where the databases are attached.
  By default this is the name of your computer (which can be written shortly using dot "."). When using the SQL Express the default
  instance name is ".\SQLExpress". The <code>Database</code> parameter specifies the name of the database, which you can see in the
  "Object Explorer" in the SQL Server Management Studio. After following these steps, you should be able to run the demo application.</p>

<h3>Data-access in F#</h3>
<p>Most of the ASP.NET technologies used in the web site are used in almost the same way as in C#, so I will not
  discuss them in larger details, but the last item in the list - the use of ASP.NET data controls together
  with F# is I believe quite interesting, so I'll write a few notes about it. Let's look for example at the
  <code>Photos.aspx</code> file, which displays a list of photos in a gallery. The most important parts
  of the file related to data access are shown in the following code snippet:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:DataList</span> <span class="attr">RunAt</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="attr">DataSourceID</span><span class="kwrd">="photoSource"</span> <span class="attr">EnableViewState</span><span class="kwrd">="false"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">ItemTemplate</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
  <span class="rem">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span><span class="kwrd">='Details.aspx?AlbumID=&lt;%# base.Eval("PhotoAlbumID") %&gt;'</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span><span class="kwrd">="Handler.ashx?PhotoID=&lt;%# base.Eval("</span><span class="attr">PhotoID</span><span class="kwrd">") %&gt;&amp;Size=S"</span> 
      <span class="attr">class</span><span class="kwrd">="photo_198"</span> <span class="attr">style</span><span class="kwrd">="border:4px solid white"</span> 
      <span class="attr">alt</span><span class="kwrd">='Thumbnail of Photo Number &lt;%# base.Eval("PhotoID") %&gt;'</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">a</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
  <span class="rem">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">ItemTemplate</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:DataList</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ObjectDataSource</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="photoSource"</span> <span class="attr">RunAt</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> 
  <span class="attr">TypeName</span><span class="kwrd">="PersonalWebSite.PhotoManager"</span> 
  <span class="attr">SelectMethod</span><span class="kwrd">="GetPhotos"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">SelectParameters</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:QueryStringParameter</span> <span class="attr">Name</span><span class="kwrd">="AlbumID"</span> <span class="attr">Type</span><span class="kwrd">="Int32"</span> 
      <span class="attr">QueryStringField</span><span class="kwrd">="albumID"</span> <span class="attr">DefaultValue</span><span class="kwrd">="0"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">SelectParameters</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ObjectDataSource</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>The first ASP.NET control used in the code is <code>asp:DataList</code>, which is a control that 
  simply displays a collection of some items and uses a specified <code>ItemTemplate</code> for displaying
  every single item. In our case we're working with collection of records and the record has several members 
  (including <code>PhotoID</code> and <code>PhotoAlbumID</code>). To display a value of a record member
  in the ASP.NET page we have to use ASP.NET <code>Eval</code> method as you can see in the sample. 
  The <code>Eval</code> method reads the specified member of the item in collection and writing the code
  in <code>&lt;%# ... %&gt;</code> tells ASP.NET that we want to render the result of the expression as
  a part of the item template.
  The record that we're using in this example is very simple and has the following structure:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">type</span> Photo = 
  { PhotoID:int; 
    PhotoAlbumID:int; 
    PhotoCaption:string; }
</pre>
<p>This is actually one of the places where the F# version is shorter, because in C# version you
  have to write this as a class with properties, which makes the code quite longer.</p>  
  
<p>The second server-side control (<code>asp:ObjectDataSource</code>) in the first code snippet isn't visual, which means that it will
  not produce any HTML output. It serves just as a declarative data-source for the data list and the properties
  of this control specify how the content for the data list should be loaded. There are various other data-source
  controls in ASP.NET (e.g. <code>asp:SqlDataSource</code> which loads data directly from the database),
  but the one that we're using in the example uses a specified .NET/F# type and calls a method of the given object
  when it needs to retrieve the data. In F# this is even easier, because we can use a name of the module and the
  code that retrieves the data can be a function in the module.</p>
<p>As you can see the property <code>TypeName</code> is set to <code>PersonalWebSite.PhotoManager</code>, which
  can be treated as a module called <code>PhotoManager</code> in a namespace <code>PersonalWebSite</code> and
  the <code>SelectMethod</code> property, which specifies a name of the function that will be called when
  loading the data is set to <code>GetPhotos</code>. Finally, the <code>SelectParameters</code> specifies
  that the function expects one argument called <code>AlbumID</code> and that the value of this argument
  should be retrieved from the query string (that is from the URL of form <code>photo.aspx?albumIdD=42</code>).</p>

<p>Now it is pretty easy to implement the module that matches this specifications and can be used as a data source
  (we could of course use FLinq for loading the data, but I wanted to keep things simple for now, so we're using
  standard <code>SqlDataReader</code> object from .NET):</p>

<pre >
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> PersonalWebSite
<span class="rem">// ...</span>

<span class="kwrd">module</span> PhotoManager = 
  <span class="rem">// Function will be called by ASP.NET when loading data</span>

<p>I hope this article explained some of the interesting things that you may find in the ASP.NET samples provided with 
  the F# distribution and I think that the Personal WebSite Sample shows that F# can be used for writing quite complicated
  web applications as well. Of course, my initial motivation for writing web applications in F# is the possibility of 
  using meta-programming to develop client-side code (the code that runs on the client as a JavaScript) in F# too, which
  makes development of modern "Ajax"-style applications easier, so if you're interested in this project you may want to look
  at F# Web Tools [<a href="#myfsstuff">1</a>].</p>
