<h1>Dynamic in F#: Reading data from SQL database</h1>
<p>When reading data from a SQL database in F#, you have a couple of options.
  You can use F# implementation of LINQ, which allows you to write queries directly
  in the F# language or you can use standard ADO.NET classes such as <code>SqlCommand</code>.
  The second option is often good enough - when you just need to call a simple 
  query, you probably don't want to setup the whole LINQ infrastructure (generate
  classes, reference F# PowerPack, etc.) Unfortunately, ADO.NET classes are a bit
  ugly to use. When calling an SQL stored procedure, you need to specify the name
  of the procedure as a string, you need to add parameters one-by-one by creating
  instances of <code>SqlParameter</code>, you need to dynamically cast results from 
  the <code>obj</code> type and so on...</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look how to use the <em>dynamic operator</em> to make the
  experience of using ADO.NET from F# dramatically better. Dynamic operator (there are
  actually two of them) are a simple way of supporting dynamic invoke in F#. We can use
  it to write code that looks almost like an ordinary method call or property access,
  but is resolved dynamically at runtime (using the name of the method or property).
  The following example shows what we'll be able to write at the end 
  of this article:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Call 'GetProducts' procedure with 'CategoryID' set to 1
use conn = new DynamicSqlConnection(connectionString)
use cmd = conn?GetProducts
cmd?CategoryID &lt;- 1
conn.Open()

// Read all products and print their names
use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
while reader.Read() do
  printfn "Product: %s" reader?ProductName
</pre>

<p>If you ever tried to call a SQL stored procedure directly using the 
  <code>SqlCommand</code>, then you can surely appreciate the elegance of this code
  snippet. Let's now take a look at a larger example and some of the neat 
  tricks that make this possible...</p>

<h2>Calling stored procedure: The usual way</h2>
<p>We'll start the article by looking at a single, more complete, example of
  calling an SQL stored procedure. I wrote this while porting the Personal Web Site
  Starter Kit to F# (which I'll describe in the next blog post). The project has 
  a simple photo gallery that contains albums and each album contains some photos.
  When reading photos from the database, we can nicely store them in the following
  F# record type:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Record type that represents photo with caption
type Photo = 
  { PhotoID:int 
    PhotoAlbumID:int
    PhotoCaption:string }
</pre>

<p>Now that we have a type to represent photos, we can look at a function
  that reads photos from the database. Our database has an SQL stored 
  procedure called <code>GetPhotos</code> that takes two parameters. The
  parameter <code>AlbumID</code> specifies the ID of the album and the
  parameter <code>IsPublic</code> specifies whether we want to get only
  publicly accessible photos in the gallery. The following function calls the
  stored procedure and reads the returned photos. The whole function body is
  wrapped in a sequence expression, so the return type will be <code>seq&lt;Photo&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Function that obtains photos in a specified album from database
let GetPhotos (albumID:int) = seq { 
  // Create a command to call SQL stored procedure
  use conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)
  use cmd = new SqlCommand("GetPhotos", conn)
  cmd.CommandType &lt;- CommandType.StoredProcedure

  // Add parameters to the stored procedure call
  cmd.Parameters.Add(SqlParameter("@AlbumID", albumID)) |&gt; ignore
  cmd.Parameters.Add(SqlParameter("@IsPublic", true)) |&gt; ignore
  
  // Run the command and read results into an F# record
  conn.Open()
  use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
  while reader.Read() do
    yield { PhotoID = unbox (reader.["PhotoID"])
            PhotoAlbumID = unbox (reader.["AlbumID"])
            PhotoCaption = unbox (reader.["Caption"])} } 
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we first create an instance of the <code>SqlConnection</code>
  type, then create a new command and set its type to <code>StoredProcedure</code>.
  Then we need to specify parameters of the procedure, which is done by calling
  <code>cmd.Parameters.Add</code>, which takes <code>SqlParameter</code> as an argument.
  To read the result, we get <code>SqlDataReader</code> and then repeatedly call
  <code>Read</code>. When processing a single result row, we need to use the 
  indexer to access individual columns of the result by name. The indexer returns
  the data as value of type <code>obj</code>, so we use <code>unbox</code> to cast
  the result to the type expected by the record.</p>
<p>There are no particularly tricky places in the code, but if you look at it,
  there is quite a lot of noise that doesn't express anything important. For 
  example, we need to create <code>SqlCommand</code> explicitly (giving it the name
  of the procedure as a string). When adding a parameter, we need to create 
  an object (giving it the name of the parameter as a string), call a method
  and ignore the result. And finally, when reading the results, we need to insert
  explicit conversion. </p>
<p>You could try writing a function for creating the SQL command to make the code
  simple. However, there are still some problems. For example, if you decided to 
  pass parameters of the procedure as a list of name-value pairs, the value would
  have to be of type <code>obj</code> and you would need to add explicit boxing.
  Luckily, we can throw all this noise away using the dynamic invoke operator...</p>

<h2>Calling stored procedure: Using dynamic operator</h2>
<p>Let's look how to write the same function using the dynamic operator. 
  In order to make this work, you need to get an implementation of the 
  operator that is available at the end of the article. The file with the 
  implementation also defines several wrapper types that add the dynamic
  functionality to standard ADO.NET types.</p>
<p>Instead of creating 
  standard <code>SqlConnection</code>, we need to create an instance of the
  <code>DynamicSqlConnection</code> type (we'll look at why this is needed and 
  how does it work soon). Once we do this change, we can use <code>?</code>
  to create commands representing SQL procedure calls, to specify parameters
  of the procedure and also to access columns when reading the result:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Function that obtains photos in a specified album from database
let GetPhotos (albumID:int) = seq { 
  use conn = new DynamicSqlConnection(connectionString)
  use cmd = conn?GetPhotos
  cmd?AlbumID &lt;- albumID
  cmd?IsPublic &lt;- true

  // Run the command and read results into an F# record
  conn.Open()
  use reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
  while (reader.Read()) do
    yield { PhotoID = reader?PhotoID 
            PhotoAlbumID = reader?AlbumID
            PhotoCaption = reader?Caption } } 
</pre>
<p>Let's now look at the most interesting places in the code where we use
  the dynamic invoke operator:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Creating commands</strong> (e.g. <code>conn?GetPhotos</code>) - Here we use the operator to create a command
    that will call the SQL stored procedure named <code>GetPhotos</code>. This snippet
    doesn't call the procedure yet - it only returns a command, so that we can 
    specify parameters of the procedure and decide how to call the command (in our
    example, we're using <code>ExecuteReader</code> to get access to the returned
    result set).</li>
  <li><strong>Setting parameters</strong> (e.g. <code>cmd?AlbumID &lt;- albumID</code>) - This is
    an example of using an operator <code>?&lt;-</code>, which sets a value of dynamically
    accessed property. We're using it to specify parameters of the command created in 
    the previous step.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessing results</strong> (e.g. <code>reader?PhotoID</code>) - 
    In this case, we're using dynamic access to get a value of a column with the
    specified name. The result type of the operator is generic and the implementation
    automatically converts the result to the specified type. Since the F# compiler
    infers the type of the result from the context (e.g. when assigning result to 
    a field of a specific type), the type casting is done fully automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking under the cover</h2>
<p>We're using the <code>?</code> operator in two ways. It can be called on an object 
  representing SQL connection (e.g. <code>conn?GetPhotos</code>) in which case it 
  returns a command for calling a stored procedure. It can be also called on an 
  object representing SQL data reader (e.g. <code>reader?PhotoID</code>) in which case
  it accesses column from the result set. As a result, we cannot write a single 
  global declaration of the operator (using the <code>let</code> keyword), but we need
  to associate the implementation with some type. However, we cannot add operators
  to existing .NET types, so we create simple wrappers for the well-known ADO.NET 
  types.</p>

<p>Let's start by looking at the <code>DynamicSqlDataReader</code> type, which 
  wraps a <code>SqlDataReader</code>. We didn't need to use this type directly in the
  previous examples, because the wrapping is done automatically - when we invoke
  <code>ExecuteReader</code> on a wrapped command object, it automatically wraps the
  returned data reader. The implementation is slightly simplified (you can get
  a full version at the end of the article), but it shows the two most important
  things. Firstly, we expose the method <code>Read</code> for iterating through the 
  result set and secondly, we implement the <code>?</code> operator for accessing 
  results. (Note that the operator must be <code>static</code>, so we need to expose
  the wrapped reader using a <code>private</code> property):</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// SqlDataReader wrapper that provides access to columns 
// of the result-set using dynamic access operator
type DynamicSqlDataReader(reader:SqlDataReader) =
  member private x.Reader = reader
  member x.Read() = reader.Read
  // Read the specified column and casts it to the specified type
  static member (?) (dr:DynamicSqlDataReader, name:string) : 'R = 
    unbox (dr.Reader.[name])
</pre>

<p>The implementation of the dynamic operator is quite simple. The only interesting
  aspect is the fact that the operator is generic (in the return type) and that 
  it uses <code>unbox</code> to convert the obtained value from <code>obj</code>
  to the type (which will be deduced by F# type inference based on how we use the
  result). The next wrapper wraps the <code>SqlCommand</code> type and adds a
  support for adding parameters using the <code>?&lt;-</code> operator:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// SqlCommand wrapper that allows setting properties of a
// stored procedure using dynamic setter operator
type DynamicSqlCommand(cmd:SqlCommand) = 
  member private x.Command = cmd
  // Adds parameter with the specified name and value
  static member (?&lt;-) (cmd:DynamicSqlCommand, name:string, value) = 
    let p = SqlParameter("@" + name, box value)
    cmd.Command.Parameters.Add(p) |&gt; ignore
  // Execute command and wrap returned SqlDataReader
  member x.ExecuteReader() = 
    new DynamicSqlDataReader(cmd.ExecuteReader())
</pre>

<p>The implementation is again pretty straightforward. Note that we need to 
  provide an operator named <code>?&lt;-</code>, because F# uses different dynamic
  access operator when reading properties and when setting value of a property. 
  The operator takes three parameters - the target command (which needs to expose
  the underlying command), a name of the property and a value to be used. We also
  expose the <code>ExecuteReader</code> method, which automatically wraps the
  returned reader (so that we can dynamically access columns).</p>
<p>The last wrapper is the only one that needs to be created explicitly. It represents
  connection to the database and provides an implementation of the <code>?</code> 
  operator that can be used for creating commands that call SQL stored procedure
  (the returned command is automatically wrapped using the previous type):</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// SqlConnection wrapper that allows creating stored 
// procedure calls using the dynamic access operator
type DynamicSqlConnection(connStr:string) =
  let conn = new SqlConnection(connStr)
  member private x.Connection = conn
  member x.Open() = conn.Open()
  // Creates command that calls the specified stored procedure
  static member (?) (conn:DynamicSqlConnection, name) = 
    let command = new SqlCommand(name, conn.Connection)
    command.CommandType &lt;- CommandType.StoredProcedure
    new DynamicSqlCommand(command)
</pre>

<p>The type exposes the <code>Open</code> method of the underlying connection and
  implements the dynamic access operator <code>?</code>. The implementation of the
  operator constructs a new command, specifies its type and wraps it using the 
  <code>DynamicSqlCommand</code> type (so that we can set parameters of the stored
  procedure call).</p>

<h2>Summary &amp; downloads</h2>
<p>In this article, we've seen how to make accessing data using ADO.NET from F# nicer 
  using dynamic operators. This allows us to reduce the number of noise that has to 
  be written in tasks related to data-access such as creating SQL commands, specifying
  parameters of a stored procedure and reading data from the returned result-set. </p>

<p>We've also seen one useful technique of implementing dynamic access in general. 
  Because we needed to provide different implementation of the operator for different
  types, we couldn't use a global implementation (written using the <code>let</code>
  keyword). Instead, we implemented the operator in several wrappers that wrap standard
  ADO.NET classes and augment them with the dynamic features. I believe that this technique can be
  quite useful in other related scenarios.</p>

<p>Below you can download the implementation of the wrappers that were used and presented
  in this article. The download doesn't contain any examples (you can use the example
  from the article as the starting point). I'll post an ASP.NET project that uses the
  wrappers in another blog post soon...</p>
