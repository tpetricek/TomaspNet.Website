<h1>Dynamic Lookup in F#</h1>
<p>Many people view <em>dynamic</em> and <em>statically-typed</em> languages as two distinct groups (and 
  this is often a reason for never-ending discussions). In this article, I'll try to show one interesting
  example, which demonstrates that these two groups are not in fact that distinct and that you can implement
  a common <em>dynamic</em> language feature in F#, which is undoubtedly <em>statically-typed</em>.
  The feature that I'm talking about is dynamic invoke using a symbolic representation of the member
  (this is something that can be done using <em>symbols</em> in Ruby, but I'll shortly explain what exactly I mean).</p>  
<p>I intentionally wrote <em>statically-typed</em> and <em>dynamic</em> instead of <em>dynamically-typed</em>.
  In my understanding <em>dynamic</em> is a broader term while <em>dynamically-typed</em> and 
  <em>statically-typed</em> are of course two distinct groups. On the other side <em>dynamic</em> refers
  to language features that are usually available in <em>dynamically-typed</em> languages, just because
  it is easy to support them in a nice way. This doesn't mean that having a <em>dynamic</em> feature in
  a <em>statically-typed</em> language would be impossible - it is just more difficult to implement it in 
  a way that would be similarly elegant.
</p>
  
<h2>Dynamic Lookup</h2>
<p>This article is motivated by an interesting <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/5986.aspx">question</a> [<a href="#dynfslinks">1</a>], which 
  was recently raised at hubFS.
  The question was, whether it is possible to read a value of a member of an F# record 
  by using a name of that member. Indeed, this is something that you would expect to see in 
  any dynamic language. As already mentioned, you can do similar things in Ruby using symbols (which are often explained
  as "something like a string", but more suitable exactly for this kind of situation) and in
  many other dynamic languages, you can do this just using strings. Basically, this means that
  you have some representation of a member (that can be for example given as an argument to a method)
  and which you can use to access the member value, but also for other manipulations with the member.
  In this article I'll use <em>dynamic invoke</em> as a name for this feature.</p>
<p>In statically-typed languages (such as F# or C#) this isn't directly supported, because the language 
  wants to guarantee that it will not be possible to write a code that attempts to access a class member 
  that doesn't exist. Clearly, this error can occur quite easily when using dynamic lookup in a dynamically-typed language.
  On .NET platform, we can of course use .NET reflection mechanism, but this solution alone isn't very elegant
  and the resulting code is not very safe (e.g. a method accepts <code>MemberInfo</code> as an argument,
  but there is no guarantee that the <code>MemberInfo</code> will represent a member from a specified class).
  Here, I'll show how to do similar thing in a much safer way in F#.
 </p>  

<h3>What exactly do we want?</h3>
<p>In this article, I'll look at slightly more interesting problem than the original question - instead of discussing
  how to get a value of the field, I'll show how to create a function that will return the value
  when it is given a value of the specified record type. This is practically more useful solution, 
  because it allows us to write the code in a more efficient way, however I'll not discuss 
  efficiency issues in this article. I'll shortly explain what this means, but let's first look
  at the F# record type that I'll use as an example:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">type</span> SampleRec = { Str : string; Num : int }
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the record type is very simplistic and serves just to show important aspects of the 
  problem. The only important thing is that it has two fields of different types, because we'll later 
  want to write a solution that will be as type-safe as possible. </p>
  
<p>Now, let's look what kind of code would we like to write using this dynamic lookup. We might for 
  example want to create two functions - one for reading the string field and second for reading the 
  number field. We don't know how to do this yet, so I'll just demonstrate the idea using pseudo-code.
  I'm using a non-existing construct `RecordType.Field` to denote some description of the field 
  that can be used programmatically. Ruby users would surely call this <em>symbol</em>, .NET programmers
  can see it as a <code>MemberInfo</code> from <code>System.Reflection</code>, though I'll shortly
  show why using simply <code>MemberInfo</code> isn't a good solution here:
</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Get a pair of functions for reading 'Str' and 'Num' fields</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readStrField = getValueReader `SampleRec.Str`
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readNumField = getValueReader `SampleRec.Num`

<span class="rem">// Create a value of the record...</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> rc = { Str = <span class="str">"Hello world!"</span>; Num = 42 }

<span class="rem">// Read 'Str' and 'Num' field using the dynamically created functions</span>
<span class="kwrd">let</span> s, n = readStrField rc, readNumField rc
</pre>
<h3>What is it good for?</h3>
<p>
  Of course, the code presented here is just an example with no big practical usefulness, but it 
  should demonstrate the idea how to implement a typical dynamic language feature in a statically typed 
  language. As we'll see later, it is possible to implement it with a surprising static type safety. In a real-world 
  application, you would use this approach for a same purpose as in dynamic languages. That is for meta-programming. 
  This may be for example for inserting some additional run-time checking, adding logging features or for manipulating 
  with the data represented by the record in some non-standard way (e.g. storing them in a database). This 
  can be nicely used together with .NET attributes that can annotate the record type and specify additional 
  properties of the values.</p>
<h3>When we don't need this?</h3>  
<p>If we didn't want to use this feature for meta-programming (e.g. together with .NET attributes) and 
  simply wanted to wrap an access to a field of the record in a code that does some additional processing, 
  then we can do this simply using F# functions:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readNumField = getValueReader (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> (rc:SampleRec) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> rc.Num)
<span class="kwrd">let</span> n = readNumField rc
</pre>
<p>Let's say that we want to write <code>getValueReader</code> that adds logging to the code.
  This means that the returned function (<code>readNumField</code>) writes the value to a console window when 
  it is called and the value of the record is accessed. In this case, the <code>getValueReader</code> 
  function which adds additional processing to the given "field reader" (a function which reads the field) can 
  be implemented in a following way:</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> getValueReader f =
  <span class="rem">// Returns a function that takes the record as an argument..</span>
  (<span class="kwrd">fun</span> rc <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 
     <span class="rem">// .. reads the value of the field using 'f' ..</span>
     <span class="kwrd">let</span> value = f rc
     <span class="rem">// .. prints the value on a console and returns it</span>
     printfn <span class="str">"%A"</span> value
     value)
</pre>
<p>This is very useful solution to a simpler kind of problem where meta-programming is not involved, but when
  you want to read the .NET attributes associated with the field and generate wrapping code depending on these
  attributes, simple functions are not powerful enough. This is because it isn't possible to inspect
  the internal structure of the function - it is just an arbitrary compiled code and for meta-programming
  we need to know something about the internal structure of the code. In case of record fields, we want to
  know what the name of the record field is as well as what .NET attributes are associated with it and so on.</p>

<h2>Statically-typed Dynamic Lookup</h2>
<p>Now that I explained why you might be interested in writing something like that, let's get back to the
  original pseudo-code. Here is a shorter version of the code (which reads just the <code>Str</code> field
  of the record):</p>
<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readStrField = getValueReader `SampleRec.Str`
<span class="kwrd">let</span> s = readStrField rc
</pre>
<p>Before we turn this into a real code, let's look at the types. Dynamic lookup is a feature known from
  dynamically typed languages, but I'm now showing how to use it in F#, so types will be quite important for us.
  In particular, we want to know what is the type of the member description (or simply a <em>symbol</em>) written
  in a backquotes. Our initial idea may be that it is simply some representation of the member (let's call it for 
  example <code>DynamicMember</code>). This would unfortunately mean that we don't know anything about type of the 
  member represented by the symbol. We don't know the type of the F# record whose member is represented by the symbol
  (in this example <code>SampleRec</code>) and we also don't know the type of the record field (in this case 
  <code>string</code>). This means that the <code>getValueReader</code> would have the following type signature:</p>
<pre >
getValueReader : DynamicMember <span class="op">-&gt;</span> (obj <span class="op">-&gt;</span> obj)
</pre>
<p>This isn't very satisfying, because we would have a function that takes an object and returns an object. This
  isn't really a code that we want to write in a statically-typed language, because we're losing all the checking 
  guaranteed by the F# type checking. So, what we'd ideally want to is to include additional information in the
  type of the symbol. This can be done in F# by using type parameters. Our representation of symbol should have two
  type parameters that can carry a type of the F# record type (in which the field belongs) and the type of the field. 
  Using this better version of symbol, we could write the following <code>getValueReader</code> function:</p>
<pre >
getValueReader : DynamicMember&lt;'recordT, 'fieldT&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> ('recordT <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 'fieldT)
</pre>
<p>Using this representation of symbols (that represent the field of the record), we can get surprising type 
  safety. You can see that the returned function (of type <code>'recordT -&gt; 'fieldT</code>) is fully typed.
  Its argument is a record, in which the symbol belongs and the result of the function has same type as the record field,
  so this is exactly the type that we want to get for a function that reads the field of the record!
  Using this representation, the type system can guarantee that we will use the dynamically constructed 
  function returned by <code>getValueReader</code> only in the correct ways.</p>
  
<p>The question that remains to be answered is: How can we get this representation of symbols in F# language?
  There is no direct language support for this, but we can use F# quotations. The following output from the
  F# interactive console shows that we can use specifc quotation syntax (I'll explain it shortly) to get
  a value that contains all the necessary type information and we can use it to define the <code>DynamicMember</code>
  type which was used in the previous examples:</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Using F# quotations mechanism...</span>
&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> dynMem = <span class="op">&lt;@</span> (<span class="op">_</span> : SampleRec).Str <span class="op">@&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">val</span> dynMem : Expr&lt;SampleRec&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Expr&lt;string&gt;

<span class="rem">// Now we can define the DynamicMember type from the previous example:</span>
&gt; <span class="kwrd">type</span> DynamicMember&lt;'a, 'b&gt; = Expr&lt;'a&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Expr&lt;'b&gt;
</pre>
<p>Let's now look at the quoted expression that we used to create our symbol representation. The simplest form
  is <code>&lt;@ _.Str @&gt;</code>, but in the previous example, I added type annotation, because otherwise the 
  F# compiler wouldn't know what is the type of the record that is used in the expression. The whole expression is
  enclosed in a quotation (<code>&lt;@ ... @&gt;</code> operator), which means that it will return some representation
  of the F# code enclosed in the operator. Quotations are somewhat similar to C# 3.0 expression trees and I already 
  discussed them on this blog [<a href="#dynfslinks">2</a>, <a href="#dynfslinks">3</a>]. The underscore symbol represents
  a hole in the quotation. A hole is simply something that can be filled in later, so if we create a hole, the 
  returned quotation is actually a function. The function takes a quotation to be filled in the hole and returns a quotation
  with the hole replaced by the argument. Let me demonstrate this using a short script from the F# interactive:</p>
<pre >
<span class="rem">// Import necessary F# namespaces for quotations</span>
&gt; <span class="preproc">#light</span>;;
&gt; <span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations;;
&gt; <span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Typed;;

<span class="rem">// Declare a quotation with a hole - returns a function </span>
&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> expr = <span class="op">&lt;@</span> 2 * <span class="op">_</span> <span class="op">@&gt;</span>;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> expr : (Expr&lt;int&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Expr&lt;int&gt;)

<span class="rem">// Fill in a quotation of '2 + 3' into a hole </span>
&gt; <span class="kwrd">let</span> filled = expr <span class="op">&lt;@</span> 2 + 3 <span class="op">@&gt;</span>;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> filled : Expr&lt;int&gt;

<span class="rem">// The result is a quoation of '2 * (3 + 4)'</span>
&gt; filled;;
<span class="kwrd">val</span> it : Expr&lt;int&gt; = <span class="op">&lt;@</span>
  (App (App op_Multiply (Int32 2))
     (App (App op_Addition (Int32 3)) (Int32 4))) <span class="op">@&gt;</span>
</pre>  
<p>Using quotations for representing symbols is quite powerful trick. The quotation can be analyzed using F# reflection
  library, so we can access all the internals. Moreover, when we use typed quotations (<code>&lt;@ ... @&gt;</code> operator)
  with hole as in the previous example, we get all the necessary type information to write a function with a fully
  type safe signature. </p>
  
<h3>Implementation Internals</h3>
<p>As a last thing in this article, I'll show you how to implement a code that simply returns a function that reads the
  value without any additional processing. In a real world, you would of course add some additional mechanism depending
  on the record field, but this isn't the point of this article. Let's first rewrite the example in pseudo-code from the 
  beginning of the article into a real F# code that uses symbols in a way introduced in this article:</p>

<pre >
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readStrField = getValueReader <span class="op">&lt;@</span> (<span class="op">_</span> : SampleRec).Str <span class="op">@&gt;</span>   
<span class="kwrd">let</span> readNumField = getValueReader <span class="op">&lt;@</span> (<span class="op">_</span> : SampleRec).Num <span class="op">@&gt;</span>   

<span class="kwrd">let</span> rc = { Str = <span class="str">"Hello world!"</span>; Num = 42 }
<span class="kwrd">let</span> s, n = readStrField rc, readNumField rc
printfn <span class="str">"Extracted: %s, %d"</span> v1 v2
</pre>
<p>This is of course syntactically a bit more complicated, because F# doesn't support symbols directly as other languages, 
  but it is still very concise code, which is useable in practice. The function <code>getValueReader</code>, which is used
  here takes a symbol represented using quotation as an argument, so it has the following type (the first version uses
  the type synonym declared earlier in the article and the second shows the internal representation using quotations):</p>
<pre >
getValueReader : (DynamicMember&lt;'recordT, 'fieldT&gt;) <span class="op">-&gt;</span> ('recordT <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 'fieldT)
getValueReader : (Expr&lt;'recordT&gt; <span class="op">-&gt;</span> Expr&lt;'fieldT&gt;)  <span class="op">-&gt;</span> ('recordT <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 'fieldT)
</pre>
<p>Let's now look at the implementation of the <code>getValueReader</code>function:</p>
<pre >
<span class="preproc">#light</span>

<span class="kwrd">open</span> System
<span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations
<span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Typed
<span class="kwrd">open</span> Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Raw

<span class="kwrd">let</span> getValueReader (prop:DynamicMember&lt;'recdT, 'fieldT&gt;) = 
  <span class="rem">// Get the information about the record type</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> rcTy = typeof&lt;'recdT&gt;
  <span class="rem">// Fill in the hole using 'dummy' quotation, so that</span>
  <span class="rem">// we can examine its internal structure</span>
  <span class="kwrd">let</span> expr = prop (Typed.of_raw (MkHole rcTy))
  
  <span class="rem">// Match the quotation representing the symbol</span>
  <span class="kwrd">match</span> expr.Raw <span class="kwrd">with</span>
  <span class="op">|</span> RecdGet (ty, nm, expr) <span class="op">-&gt;</span>
      <span class="rem">// It represents reading of the F# record field..</span>
      <span class="rem">// .. get a function that reads the record field using F# reflection</span>
      <span class="kwrd">let</span> rdr = Reflection.Value.GetRecordFieldReader (ty, nm)
      
      <span class="rem">// we're not adding any additional processing, so we just</span>
      <span class="rem">// simply add type conversion to the correct types &amp; return it</span>
      ((box &gt;&gt; rdr &gt;&gt; unbox) : 'recdT <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 'fieldT)
  <span class="op">|</span> <span class="op">_</span> <span class="op">-&gt;</span> 
      <span class="rem">// Quotation doesn't represent symbol - this is an error</span>
      failwith <span class="str">"Invalid expression - not reading record field!"</span>
</pre>
<p>First, we need to get the internal representation of the quotation. Since the argument (quotation with a hole) is a function, 
  we first need to apply it to some argument, so that we can access the code represented by the quotation. It is not important
  what will be inserted in place of the hole in the quotation, so we just create an untyped quotation that represents another
  hole and fill it in place of the original hole (this is just a trick that turns a function of type <code>Expr&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Expr&lt;'b&gt;</code>
  into a quotation of type <code>Expr&lt;'b&gt;</code>, but it doesn't change the internal value in any way).</p>
<p>Anyway, the rest of the code is more interesting - it first uses pattern matching and the particularly the pattern <code>RecdGet</code>
  to test whether the quotation represents a code that reads an F# record field. If yes, it uses F# reflection (<code>GetRecordFieldReader</code>)
  to get a function which reads the F# record field. This function isn't however strongly typed, so the type of <code>rdr</code> is 
  <code>obj -&gt; obj</code>. As a last step, we use the type information that we obtained from the statically-typed representation 
  of the symbol to convert this function into a strongly typed function of type <code>'recdT -&gt; 'fieldT</code>.</p>
<p>In a real-world code that adds some functionality using meta-programming, you would do modifications in two parts of the code. 
  First, you would use the structures obtained using pattern matching and F# reflection to discover more information about the
  record type. The most usual case that I can think of is reading .NET attributes associated with the record type or with the members of the record,
  however there are probably many other useful uses. Second thing that you would modify is a code that returns the function - here we
  simply obtained a function for reading the field, but the point of meta-programming is to do something more interesting here. The key
  idea however is that the code can return a statically-typed function, which makes the code that uses this form of dynamic meta-programming
  statically type-safe.</p>  
  
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article we've seen that a feature that is usually present in <em>dynamic</em> languages can be very nicely 
  used in <em>statically-typed</em> F# as well. We've seen that using F# quotations, we can work with a representation of record field, 
  which is in many ways similar to symbols known from Ruby (and similar features in other dynamic languages). Even though it is 
  possible to achieve similar things by using strings using .NET reflection, the solution that I demonstrated here as one important
  advantage - the code that we write is statically type-safe, which makes the code more robust.</p>
<p>In general, you could implement similar feature in C# 3.0 using lambda expressions (treated as an 
  expression tree - that is you'd have to specify that it has a type <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>),
  however in C#, it much more depends on the particular problem that you want to solve. The code that would represent the symbol would be
  <code>(SampleRec rc) => rc.Str</code> and its type would be <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;SampleRec, string&gt;&gt;</code>.
  Nevertheless, this is would be a topic for another article...
