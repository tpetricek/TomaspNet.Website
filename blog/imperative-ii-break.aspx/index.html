<h1>Imperative computation in F# (II.) - Writing break and continue</h1>
<p>As I already wrote in the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/imperative-i-return.aspx">first part of this series</a>,
  the F# language doesn't support some of the language constructs known from imperative
  languages such as C#. In particular, we cannot use imperative <code>return</code> statement
  that returns the result of a function from any place in the function code. In functional languages,
  every construct is an expression, so to get the overall result of the function, the 
  F# language evaluates the expression and the value of the expression is used as the result.
  In the previous article, we've seen that we can simulate this construct in the F# language
  using F# computation expressions and I showed how to implement computation named <code>imperative</code>
  that allows us to write for example the <code>exists</code> function for working with sequences
  like this:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let exists f inp = imperative {
  for v in inp do 
    if f(v) then return true
  return false }
</pre>  
<p>In this article, we're going to look at two more imperative constructs and we're going
  to talk about <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. We'll see that we can quite
  easily extend the computation builder from the previous article to allow writing code
  that is syntactically very close to what you would write in C#. As I already mentioned,
  there are of course some performance overheads when using computation expressions, but 
  I find it very interesting how nice imperative syntax we can get in functional F#:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
imperative { 
  for x in 1 .. 10 do 
    if (x % 3 = 0) then do! continue
    printfn "number = %d" x }
</pre>  
<p>The only difference between this code and the code we'd probably write if F# supported
  <code>continue</code> as a keyword is that we need to wrap the code inside the <code>imperative</code>
  computation and that we need to add the <code>do!</code> primitive before the <code>continue</code>
  value. Now that we've seen an example of using the <code>continue</code> value inside
  the imperative computations, let's look how we can extend the computation builder from
  the previous article to add this feature...</p>  
  
<h2>Supporting break and continue</h2>  
<p>To add support for the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> primitives, we'll need to 
  slightly modify the type that represents the computation and then update the computation builder
  that we implemented in the previous article. As you can probably guess, the largest changes 
  will be done in the code that builds computation representing two F# looping constructs - 
  <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. Let's start by looking at the computation type.</p>

<h3>Designing the computation type</h3>
<p>In the previous part of the series, we represented the computation as a function that takes
  <code>unit</code> as the argument and returns <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code>. This allowed us
  to represent the case when the computation hasn't yet finished, because the <code>return</code>
  primitive wasn't used (the function returns <code>None</code>) and the case when the computation
  already has some result value (returning <code>Some</code>). To support the two jumping constructs,
  we'll need to add a case that represents a computation that is <em>jumping</em> out of the 
  iteration of a loop. We can declare the type like this:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
type ImperativeResult&lt;'T&gt; = 
  | ImpValue of 'T
  | ImpJump of bool
  | ImpNone 
  
type Imperative&lt;'T&gt; = unit -&gt; ImperativeResult&lt;'T&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>ImperativeResult&lt;'T&gt;</code> type is in principle just an extension of the 
  <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type that adds one case - the <code>ImpJump</code> discriminator.
  The <code>bool</code> parameter specifies whether we want to continue executing the next 
  iteration of the loop after we break out of the current iteration. The value will be <code>true</code>
  when the user calls the <code>continue</code> primitive and for <code>break</code> we'll set
  it to <code>false</code>. The actual type that represents the computation is again
  just a function that returns one of the possible computation results.</p>

<h3>Implementing the computation builder</h3> 
<p>We'll split the implementation of the computation expression builder in a similar way
  as in the previous article and we'll start with the basic primitives that aren't related
  to loops. </p> 

<pre lang="fsharp">
type ImperativeBuilder() = 
  // When returning a value, we'll use the 'ImpValue' discriminator
  member x.Return(v) : Imperative&lt;_&gt; = 
    (fun () -&gt; ImpValue(v))
  // Expression that doesn't represent any value returns 'ImpNone'
  member x.Zero() = (fun () -&gt; ImpNone)
  
  // Create a delayed imperative computation from a function
  member x.Delay(f:unit -&gt; Imperative&lt;_&gt;) = 
    (fun () -&gt; f()())

  // Combine two delayed computations that may return or jump
  member x.Combine(a, b) = (fun () -&gt;
    match a() with 
    // The computation doesn't have value - evaluate the next
    | ImpNone -&gt; b() 
    // If the computation returned value or called break/return
    // we'll propagate the value representing the result
    | res -&gt; res)
  
  // Execute the imperative computation given as the argument  
  member x.Run&lt;'T&gt;(imp) = 
    // When the computation returns 'ImpJump' it is an indication
    // that 'break' or 'continue' was used incorrectly.
    match imp() with
    | ImpValue(v) -&gt; v
    | ImpJump _ -&gt; failwith "Invalid use of break/continue!"
    | _ -&gt; failwith "No value has been returend!"

let imperative = new ImperativeBuilder()  
</pre>
<p>If you compare the listing with the code from the previous article, you'll see
  that there are relatively few changes. First of all, we've changed all occurrences
  of <code>None</code> into <code>ImpNone</code> and also all uses of <code>Some</code>
  into <code>ImpValue</code>, which are our new representations of missing or present values.
  However, there are a few places where we needed to modify the code to correctly handle
  <code>ImpJump</code> values. In the <code>Combine</code> primitive, we're now 
  returning the result of the first computation not only when it is a result created
  using <code>return</code>, but also when the user uses <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>
  and we'll get the <code>ImpJump</code> value. This means that when we're combining two 
  pieces of computations inside the body of the loop, we won't execute the second 
  computation if the first one contained a jumping construct. As a next change, we also added 
  a new case to the <code>Run</code> primitive which returns an error if the 
  computation ends with a value representing a jump. This means that a <code>break</code> or
  <code>continue</code> construct was used outside of a loop, which is incorrect.</p>  
 
<h3>Adding support for loops</h3>
<p>Most of the interesting changes in the code will be in the parts that implement
  looping constructs. In particular, we'll use a different primitive for composing 
  iterations of the loop - in the previous article we just used the <code>Combine</code>
  member from both <code>While</code> and <code>For</code>. However, in the new version,
  we'll need to handle loops differently. Before the computation can start a new iteration
  of a loop, it needs to check whether the previous iteration returned <code>ImpJump</code>.
  If it returned value representing <code>break</code> then we'll need to break the loop
  immediately without returning a result. If the previous iteration contained the <code>continue</code>
  construct, then we'll just continue executing the next iteration - the jump represented by 
  <code>continue</code> was already performed because we didn't run any more code after
  reaching the <code>continue</code> primitive in the previous iteration (this is the 
  case, because the <code>Combine</code> primitive doesn't call the second computation when
  it gets <code>ImpJump</code> as the result from the first one).</p>  

<pre lang="fsharp">
type ImperativeBuilder with 
  // A local helper used when composing iterations of loops
  // in the 'For' and 'While' primitives below.
  member x.CombineLoop(a, b) = (fun () -&gt;
    match a() with 
    // When the last iteration returns a value, propagate the result
    | ImpValue(v) -&gt; ImpValue(v) 
    // The last iteration contained 'break', so we'll 
    // return missing value as the result from the loop
    | ImpJump(false) -&gt; ImpNone
    // When the last iteration didn't contain any special construct
    // or when it ended with 'continue', we'll continue looping
    | ImpJump(true)
    | ImpNone -&gt; b() )
  
  // 'For' and 'While' members that implement the looping constructs
  // are similar as in the previous version, with the exception that they
  // compose iterations using the special 'CombineLoop' primitive
  member x.For(inp:seq&lt;_&gt;, f) =
    let rec loop(en:IEnumerator&lt;_&gt;) = 
      if not(en.MoveNext()) then x.Zero() else
        x.CombineLoop(f(en.Current), x.Delay(fun () -&gt; loop(en)))
    loop(inp.GetEnumerator())
  member x.While(gd, body) = 
    let rec loop() =
      if not(gd()) then x.Zero() else
        x.CombineLoop(body, x.Delay(fun () -&gt; loop()))
    loop()         
  
  // A call to this member is inserted when we use the 'do!' construct. If the 'v'
  // value is either 'break' or 'continue', we will return 'ImpJump' as the result
  member x.Bind(v:Imperative&lt;unit&gt;, f : unit -&gt; Imperative&lt;_&gt;) = (fun () -&gt;
    match v() with
    | ImpJump(kind) -&gt; ImpJump(kind)
    | _ -&gt; f()() )
     
// Primitives that return the 'ImpJump' value when executed 
let break = (fun () -&gt; ImpJump(false))
let continue = (fun () -&gt; ImpJump(true))
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we've added a primitive named <code>CombineLoop</code> and used
  it instead of the usual <code>Combine</code> when implementing the looping constructs.
  The reason for this change is that once we introduce <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>,
  we need to handle them differently when composing for example a sequence of statements
  and when composing iterations of a loop. </p>
<p>The listing also defines two primitive values of the <code>Imperative&lt;'T&gt;</code> type
  that simply return the <code>ImpJump</code> result. Note that these give us the only
  way we can use to build a computation that contains jumps. We've also added the <code>Bind</code>
  member to the computation builder, which means that we can now write <code>do!</code>
  inside the computation expression. The only values of the <code>Imperative&lt;'T&gt;</code> type
  that we have available are <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>, so they are the
  only two primitives that we can use with the <code>do!</code> construct.</p>  
  
<h2>Using 'break' and 'continue' in F#</h2>
<p>Now we have everything we need to write imperative loops with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>
  in F#. I'm sure you know many cases where these primitives are useful, so let's just briefly look
  at two simple snippets that demonstrate how we can use them. In the first example, we'll
  write a <code>for</code> loop and we'll use <code>continue</code> to skip evaluation of some iterations
  of the loop: </p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; imperative { 
    for x in 1 .. 5 do 
      if (x % 2 = 0) then do! continue
      printfn "number = %d" x };;
<em>number = 1
number = 3
number = 5</em>
</pre>

<p>The second example will use a <code>while</code> loop with <code>true</code> as the condition. However,
  we can now jump out of the loop, so the loop isn't infinite as it may look. We're using a single
  mutable variable (using F# reference cell) and we increment it in each iteration. When the number
  reaches some number, we'll stop looping using <code>break</code>:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">    
&gt; imperative { 
    let x = ref 1
    while true do
      if (!x % 4 = 0) then do! break
      printfn "number = %d" !x
      x := !x + 1 };;
<em>number = 1
number = 2
number = 3</em>
</pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As I already wrote in the introduction and in the first article of this series, the most interesting
  thing about the <code>imperative</code> computation builder is that it gives us a surprisingly elegant
  syntax to write imperative constructs in F#. The syntax almost doesn't differ from you'd write
  if F# supported these imperative constructs directly. On the other hand, the performance may be 
  an issue, because computation expressions are translated into member calls that take lambda 
  functions as arguments, so there is definitely some overhead.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is first of all to demonstrate the flexibility of the F# language
  and to show an implementation of an interesting <em>computation expression</em>. Actually, 
  writing <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> in functional languages isn't a new idea.
  There is an example how to do this using the <em>continuation monad</em> in Haskell [<a href="#imperfs2">1</a>]
  and Brian McNamara has posted a translation of this in F# [<a href="#imperfs2">2</a>]. However,
  none of these get us a very pleasant syntax, which is I believe quite important aspect.</p>

    <p>I submitted my PhD thesis at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>,
      working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed 
      prog&shy;ramming or data-flow). See <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/">my academic page</a> for
      more.</p>
