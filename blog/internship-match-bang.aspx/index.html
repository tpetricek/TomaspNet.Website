<h1>Internship project: Reactive pattern matching</h1>

  style="border:0px;float:left; margin:20px" />
</a>

<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-source-available.aspx">mentioned</a> that I was doing my second internship
  with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a> at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
  This time, I was in Cambridge for 6 months from October until April, so it has been more than a month since 
  I left, but as you can guess I didn't have time to write anything about the internship until now... There isn't
  much to say though, because the internship was simply fantastic. Cambridge is a beautiful place (here are
  some <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2008%20Autumn%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">autumn</a> and <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">winter</a> photos),
  the Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge is full of smart people, so it is a perferct working environment
  (except that you realize that you're not as clever as you think :-)). Also, it is just a few meters away from the
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" type="external">Computer Laboratory</a> of the Cambridge University, so there are always many 
  interesting talks and seminars. So, big thanks to Don Syme, James Margetson and everyone else who I had a chance 
  to work with during the internship.</p>
  
<p>One of the reasons why I didn't have much time to write about the internship earlier is that I
  was invited to the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> shortly
  after the end of the internship. I had a chance to talk about my project there as well and there is
  even a video recording from the talk (the link is below), so you can watch it to find out more about my recent F# work.</p>
  
<p>I was working on a couple of things during the internship. During the first couple of months, I was helping
  the F# team on Visual Studio language service for F#. This includes IntelliSense, syntax highlighting 
  and things like that. All the improvements that I and others on the team worked on should be available in Visual 
  Studio 2010 from the beta 1 version, so I believe the IntelliSense will work noticeably better than it 
  does in the CTP. The Language Service for F# is quite interesting project in many ways, because the F# compiler
  needs to do a lot of work in background (most importantly type inference). This means that getting the 
  right information for the IntelliSense popup window needs to use several different approaches to make sure
  that you'll see useful items even when the compiler hasn't completed background checking or when the source
  code just changed.</p>

<h2>Reactive Pattern Matching</h2>
<p>The other thing that I was working larg part of the time is <em>Reactive Pattern Matching</em>. The goal 
  of the project was to make it easier to write F# applications that react to external events from the user
  interface or for example from background working threads. The project focuses on applications (or parts of
  applications) that are highly reactive and it is based on the F# asynchronous workflows. Here are a couple
  of points about reactive applications and about the way we tried to make writing them easier in F#:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single threaded</strong> - The application (or for example GUI component) runs as a 
    single threaded component, but the code is written by creating multiple agents that express parts
    of the behavior. This makes it easier to reason about how the external events are handled.
    This of course doesn't mean that the whole application is single-threaded. You can have various background
    threads doing all sorts of computations. Only the synchronization point (e.g. the GUI) is single-threaded.</li>    
    
  <li><strong>Quick reactions</strong> - The agents that we write spend most of the time waiting for
    some events, which means that the application can consist of a large number of agents. This means
    that agents are used to structure the source code based on what kind of "workflows" the application performs.</li>    
  
  <li><strong>Minimal direct langauge support</strong> - The project uses mostly the existing F# language
    with a single extension to allow pattern matching in computation expressions (using the <code>match!</code>
    construct), which is a more generally useful language feature. Aside from this single extension,
    most of the work is to find the right programming model, which is just a question of implementing
    the right library and computation expression builders.</li>
</ul>  
  
<p>The project is inspired by <a href="http://www.haskell.org/frp/" type="external">Functional Reactive Programming</a>
  and it takes some ideas from my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iv-reactivegame.aspx">Reactive LINQ</a> and
  also from some examples I wrote for <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net/" type="external">chapter 16 of my book</a>. 
  However, it is still quite far from being complete and I'm planning to continue working on it, so you'll 
  definitely hear more about this.</p>

<h2>My talk at Lang.NET Symposium</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, shortly after returning from Cambridge to Prague, I was on the plane again, but this time 
  to Redmond for the Lang.NET Symposium. This year, there were quite a few interesting talks. Ted Leung wrote
  <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2009/04/16/langnet-2009/" type="external">has a nice summary</a> for some
  of them. I quite liked the fact that the talks ranged from more theoretical and research oriented topics.
  For example, the talk <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/29-PhilipWadler-Links.html" type="external">Links: Web programming without tiers</a>
  by Philip Wadlers was quite interesting for me, because the Links project is closely related to my F# WebTools. 
  On the other hand there were talks about Microsoft projects that are becoming mainstream including
  <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/34-ManuelFahndrich-CodeContracts.html" type="external">Code Contracts</a>
  and Luke Hoban's talk <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/25-LukeHoban-FSharpProductization.html" type="external">Productization of F#</a>,
  which both talk about things that are going to be available in Visual Studio 2010.</p>

<p>There was also a very interesting talk from Erik Meijer about the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/23-ErikMeijer-LiveLabsReactiveFramework.html" type="external">Live Labs Reactive Framework</a>.
  The talk was a lot of fun, but more importantly, it was about project that's closely related to what I was working on - in particular 
  it is related to my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-iv-reactivegame.aspx">Reactive LINQ</a> project and Reactive Pattern Matching for F#. 
  I also had a chance to chat with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/" type="external">Wes Dyer</a>, who is working on this project.

<p><a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/22-TomasPatricek-Reactive.html" type="external">My talk</a> at Lang.NET was 
  about the <em>Reactive Pattern Matching</em> project that I started working on during the internship with Don Syme. The
  talk provides some background on asynchronous programming in F# using <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and then focuses on the project I was working on.
  About half of the talk uses only language features that are already available in F#, namely <em>asynchronous workflows</em>,
  but uses them differently - to write single threaded reactive code that uses asynchronous workflows to wait for events in general rather than just for waiting of a completion of asynchronous I/O operation. </p>

<p>In the second part, the talk looks at reactive programming
  using the <code>match!</code> construct, which can be used for pattern matching over events. This lets you
  succinctly write code that for says things like "Wait for the first occurrence MouseDown event or for the MouseMove event 
  when the X location is more than 100".</p>
<p> Finally, the talk also mentions how the <code>match!</code> primitive
  can be used for encoding other interesting programming models. This part didn't limit to single-threaded reactive programming, but talked about concurrency models such as working with futures (from the Task Parallel Library) or Joins known from the
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/comega/" type="external">Cω language</a>.</p>
