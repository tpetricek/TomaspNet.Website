<h1>Calling functions in LINQ queries</h1>




<p>The LINQ project (see [<a href="#lqlinks">1</a>]) is an extension to .NET Framework and most common .NET languages (C# and VB.Net) 
  that extends these languages with query operators and some other features that make it possible to integrate 
  queries in the languages. This article requieres some previous knowledge of LINQ and C# 3, so I recomend looking at the
  the specification at LINQ home page.</p>
<h2><span class="hn">1</span>What is and what isn't possible</h2>
<p>There is a limitation of what you can write in a DLINQ query. This is clear, because DLINQ queries are translated 
  at runtime to T-SQL statements, so the possibilities of DLINQ queries are limited by the T-SQL language. Conversion to T-SQL 
  supports many of standard language constructs, but it can hardly support calling of your methods for two reasons. First 
  (more important) reason is that the method is compiled and it is not possible to get its expression tree (as long as you don't 
  use utility like Reflector). The second reason is that T-SQL is very limited when compared with C# as I mentioned earlier, although saying that T-SQL 
  is limited is not fair, because it has different purpose than languages like C# and it does it very well. 
  Let's take a look at the following example. It is a simple DLINQ query against the Northwind database that calls function 
  <code>MyTest</code> in the <code>where</code> clause:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// function used in filter</span><br />
<span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">bool</span> MyFunc(Nwind.Product p)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> p.ProductName.StartsWith("B");
}</pre>
<pre>
<span class="c">// query that uses MyFunc</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
  <span class="k">where</span> MyPriceFunc(p.UnitPrice) &gt; 30m
  <span class="k">select</span> p
</pre>

<p>It compiles with no errors, but when you execute it DLINQ throws an exception saying: "Static method System.Boolean MyTest(LINQTest.Nwind.Product) 
  has no supported translation to SQL." The exception is actually thrown when you try to fetch results from <code>q</code> (for example
  using the <code>foreach</code> statement), because DLINQ attempts to convert the expression trees to T-SQL only when the results are 
  needed and the query must be executed. To fix the example you can simply copy the code that checks whether product name starts 
  with "B" to the <code>where</code> clause of the query and it would work fine. </p>
<p>I'd say that checking whether query can be translated to T-SQL at runtime is slightly against the DLINQ objective to catch all errors
  at compile time, but this is not the aim of the article. Also the rules for writing correct queries are not difficult. You can use all 
  operators and some basic methods (like <code>String.StartsWith</code>) for working with numbers and strings, but you can't call 
  any other methods, particlularly methods that you wrote.</p>
  
<h2><span class="hn">2</span>The problem</h2>  

<p>The problem I wanted to solve is that you can't call your methods from queries. If you have a more complex application with 
  many similar queries it would be natural to put the common subqueries to some function that is called by other queries.
  For example you might want to write function that does some price calculations or function that selects information about one
  significant product in category. If you look at some questions in MSDN Forums you can see that I'm not the only one who is asking 
  for this (see [<a href="#lqlinks">2</a>]).</p>
<p>First I'll show a little example that demonstrates what you can do with the library I wrote to keep your interest and than I'll 
  explain the solution details. The following query selects products from the Northwind database and performs calculation 
  of price for every product. Because we want to select only products that cost more than 30, the price calculation is repeated
  twice in the query: </p>  
<pre>
<span class="c">// Notice that code for calculating price is repeated</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
    <span class="k">where</span> (p.UnitPrice * 1.19m) &gt; 30.0m
    <span class="k">select</span> <span class="k">new</span>
      { 
        p.ProductName, 
        OriginalPrice = p.UnitPrice,
        ShopPrice = (p.UnitPrice * 1.19m)
      };
</pre>
<p>Using the extensions that I'll describe later you can extract price calculation to lambda expression and use this
  expression in the query. Following code can be used for querying both database and in-memory objects, because it 
  is possible to translate the lambda expression to T-SQL as well as execute it at runtime:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// Lambda expression that calculates the price</span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;Nwind.Product, decimal?&gt;&gt; calcPrice = 
  (p) =&gt; p.UnitPrice * 1.19m;

<span class="c">// Query that selects products</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products.<strong>ToExpandable()</strong><br />
<span class="k">  where</span> calcPrice.<strong>Invoke(p)</strong> &gt; 30.0m
    <span class="k">select</span> <span class="k">new</span> 
      { 
        p.ProductName, 
        OriginalPrice = p.UnitPrice,
        ShopPrice = calcPrice<strong>.Invoke(p)</strong>
      };
</pre>
<p>Declaration of lambda expression that will be used by the query is straightforward, because it isn't different 
  than any other C# 3 lambda expressions. The query is more interesting because it uses two extension different methods.
  First method called <code>ToExpandable</code> creates a thin wrapper around the DLINQ <code>Table</code> object.
  Thanks to this wrapper you can use second method called <code>Invoke</code> that extends the <code>Expression</code> 
  class to invoke the lambda expression while making it still possible to translate query to T-SQL. This works
  because when converting to the expression tree, the wrapper replaces all occurrences of <code>Invoke</code> method by
  expression trees of the invoked lambda expression and passes these expressions to DLINQ that is able to translate 
  the expanded query to T-SQL.</p>

<h2><span class="hn">3</span>Implementation details</h2>
<h3><span class="hn">3.1</span>Expression expansion</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, the crucial task for making the previous code work is replacing calls to <code>Invoke</code> (extension) 
  method with the actual expression tree of the used lambda expression. This is done behind the scene by the wrapper 
  created by <code>ToExpandable</code> in the previous code, but you can do it directly as you can see in the following example:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// Declare 'calc' that will be used by other lambda expressions</span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt; calc = 
    i =&gt; i * 10;

<span class="c">// Expression that uses 'calc' (Invoke is an extension method)</span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt; test =
    i =&gt; calc.Invoke(i) + 2;
</pre>
<p>The first declaration in this example creates expression tree for lambda expression that multiplies its parameter by 10,
  later this expression can be used by other expressions (like <code>test</code> that calls <code>calc</code> and adds 2 to the result).
  To use expression you have to use <code>Invoke</code> extension method that is declared in the <code>ExpressionExtensions</code> class
  (<code>EeekSoft.Expressions</code> namespace). This method is very simple, because it just uses <code>Compile</code> method 
  of the expression and executes the compiled delegate, but if you write <code>calc.Compile().Invoke(i)</code> directly to the 
  expression it is partially evaluated while creating expression tree and it will not be possible to get expression tree of 
  the used lambda expression.</p>
<p>The expansion can be done by the <code>Expand</code> extension method that is also declared in <code>ExpressionExtensions</code>.
  This is possible when you have variable of <code>Expression</code> or <code>Expression&lt;F&gt;</code> type, where <code>F</code> is one of the
  <code>Func</code> delegates. The following example demonstrates the expansion (some variables from previous example are used):</p>  
<pre>
<span class="c">// Expand the expression using Expand extension method </span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt; expanded1 = 
    test.Expand();
    
<span class="c">// You can use var because type is the same as the type of 'test' </span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> expanded2 = test.Expand();

<span class="c">// Output text representation of both expressions </span>
Console.WriteLine("Original: {0}", test.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("Expanded: {0}", expanded2.ToString());
</pre>
<p class="ni">The output is following:</p>
<pre>
Original: i =&gt; Add(i =&gt; Multiply(i, 10).Invoke(i), 2)
Expanded: i =&gt; Add(Multiply(i, 10), 2)
</pre>  
<p>You can see that using of <code>Expand</code> extension method is very simple. This example also showed that
  you can use <code>var</code> keyword and let the compiler infer the type of returned expression. This is possible because
  the type of returned expression is same as the type of variable, on which the extension method is invoked or 
  in other words as the parameter passed to the method.</p>
  
<p>Now, let's examine the output printed in the previous example. The first line represents the original expression before 
  calling the <code>Expand</code> method. You can see that expression <code>calc</code> is printed using syntax for 
  lambda expressions as part of the <code>test</code> expression. The important point here is that we didn't lose the expression
  tree of this inner expression. The inner expression is followed by the call to <code>Invoke</code> method and it is part of 
  the <code>Add</code> expression that represents addition in the <code>test</code>.</p>
  
<p>The second line represents expression tree that is created by the <code>Expand</code> method. You can see that 
  inner lambda expression and call to the <code>Invoke</code> method was replaced by its expression tree, which is
  multiplication applied to the parameter and the number 10. This representation can be later converted to T-SQL, because
  it doesn't contain any calls to .NET methods that could not be translated. If you try to use non-expanded expression
  the conversion will fail on the call to the <code>Invoke</code> method. </p>

<p>Question that could came to your mind is why do you have to call expression that will later be replaced using 
  the <code>Invoke</code> method instead of <code>Compile().Invoke(..)</code> code that does exactly the same thing. 
  It is because when C# 3 builds the expression tree it executes the <code>Compile</code> method and the 
  expression tree of the inner expression is be replaced by delegate, so it would not be possible to access the original
  expression tree. This is demonstrated by the following example:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// What happens when we use Compile() instead of Invoke()?</span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt; wrong =
  i =&gt; calc.Compile().Invoke(i) + 2;
Console.WriteLine(wrong.ToString());
</pre>
<p>The following output contains the delegate which is the result of <code>Compile</code> method (embedded using <code>value</code>)
  instead of inner expression tree that is needed for replacement:</p>
<pre>
i =&gt; Add(value(System.Query.Func`2
       [System.Int32,System.Int32]).Invoke(i), 2)
</pre>

<p>You may be also wondering whether you could write <code>(x =&gt; calc.Invoke(x) + 1).Expand()</code> instead of using a variable
  for expression tree. If you try it, you'll get an error message saying that "Operator '.' cannot be applied to operand of type anonymous method."
  The problem here is that compiler needs some way to decide whether lambda expression should be returned as a delegate or as 
  an expression tree. This depends on the type of variable to which lambda expression is assigned and in this code it is
  not clear what should the type of return value be. Anyway you can expand lambda expression if you call the <code>Expand</code>
  method as standard static method. In this case compiler knows what the expected type of parameter is and it can decide whether
  it should return delegate or expression tree:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// Use Expand as standard static method</span>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt; ret = 
  ExpressionExtensions.Expand&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt;
    ( (int x) =&gt; calc.Invoke(x) + 2 );
    
<span class="c">// In this case type is specified so you can use var</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> ret = ExpressionExtensions.Expand&lt;Func&lt;<span class="k">int</span>, <span class="k">int</span>&gt;&gt;
  ( x =&gt; calc.Invoke(x) + 2 );
</pre>
<p>This would be even more interesting if C# 3 were able to infer return type from the type of lambda expression,
  but this is not possible in the current version, so you have to specify type explicitly. In this case type arguments of 
  method <code>Expand</code> are specified so both type of method parameter and its return value are known.
  Because the return type is known, it is also possible to use new <code>var</code> keyword for declaring variables with infered type.</p>

<h3><span class="hn">3.2</span>DLINQ integration</h3>
<p>The latest LINQ preview contains one very important feature that makes LINQ extensible and it allows anybody
  to write his own provider that takes expression tree representation of the LINQ query and executes it  
  (for download visit the project homepage [<a href="#lqlinks">1</a>], for more info on the latest release see 
  Matt Warren's weblog [<a href="#lqlinks">3</a>]). This extensibility is possible thanks to the <code>IQueryable</code> 
  interface that contains aside from other methods,
  the <code>CreateQuery</code> method. This method is used by LINQ for building the expression trees that represent the 
  query which is, in case of DLINQ translated to T-SQL and executed on the database side.</p>  
<p>I created a simple wrapper around DLINQ implementation that expands all expressions while building 
  the query. Of course the translation to T-SQL is done by the wrapped DLINQ object. The wrapper is the <code>ExpandableWrapper</code>
  class which implements the <code>IQueryable</code> interface. Actually, the <code>ExpandableWrapper</code> is wrapper
  around any class that implements the <code>IQueryable</code> interface so you should be able to use it with any 
  other providers that allow you to execute LINQ queries. Some of these providers were mentioned in Channel9 video 
  [<a href="#lqlinks">4</a>], so in the future you should be able to use this extension with entities (in future version of ADO.NET) as well as
  any third party OR mapper that supports LINQ.</p>
<p class="ni">Lets look at the example similar to the one I presented at the beginning:</p>
<pre>
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products.ToExpandable()
    <span class="k">where</span> calcPrice.Invoke(p) &gt; 30.0m
    <span class="k">select</span> p;
</pre>
<p>In this query, the <code>ToExpandable</code> method is used for creating the wrapper around DLINQ object that represents 
  database table. When LINQ builds the expression tree that represents the query, it uses <code>CreateQuery</code> method
  of this wrapper instead of underlying DLINQ <code>Table</code> object. This is the trick that makes the expansion work,
  because the wrapper simply calls <code>Expand</code> method described in the previous section and than calls the 
  <code>CreateQuery</code> of underlying DLINQ object. The returned value is wrapped using new instance of 
  the <code>ExpandableWrapper</code> class, because when building queries that contain both <code>where</code> and
  <code>select</code> clauses, LINQ calls <code>CreateQuery</code> method of the returned object again. </p>
<p class="ni">This is the implementation of <code>CreateQuery</code> method:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// Creates query from expanded expression using underlying object
// (_item is underlying IQueryable passed in the constructor)</span><br />
<span class="k">public</span> IQueryable&lt;S&gt; CreateQuery&lt;S&gt;(Expression expression)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> ExpandableWrapper&lt;S&gt;
    (_item.CreateQuery&lt;S&gt;(expression.Expand()));
}</pre>
<p class="ni">The method that creates first <code>ExpandableWrapper</code> is already mentioned method <code>ToExpandable</code>:</p>		
<pre>
<span class="c">// Returns wrapper that automatically expands expressions</span><br />
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> IQueryable&lt;T&gt; ToExpandable&lt;T&gt;(<span class="k">this</span> IQueryable&lt;T&gt; q)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> ExpandableWrapper&lt;T&gt;(q);
}
</pre>


<h2><span class="hn">4</span>Beta version difficulties</h2>
<p>There are several difficulties that appeared during implementation of this project, some of them will be 
  probably fixed before final version of the LINQ project will be released, some of them are caused by design.</p>
  
<p>First problem I'd like to mention is regarding limited scope of anonymous types. As you know, anonymous 
  types can be used only locally inside body of one method. This prevents developers from overusing anonymous
  types in situations where anonymous types are not needed and would lead to unreadable code. On the other side 
  if you want to use expression that will be later used in the <code>select</code> clause and that will be defined
  globally, for example as public property of some class, you have to explicitly define its return type
  instead of using anonymous type as you do in all other DLINQ queries.</p>  

<p>The second problem comes out when you want to declare expression returning anonymous type only locally inside 
  method body. You can't use <code>var</code>, because you have to declare variable as either <code>Expression</code>
  or <code>Func</code>, so that compiler knows whether you want delegate or expression tree, but you can't
  declare it, because you need the name of returned anonymous type. I think that solution for this problem would be 
  allowing something like this (though I'm not sure whether this is an acceptable solution):</p>
<pre>
Expression&lt;Func&lt;Product,_&gt;&gt; selector = 
  p =&gt; <span class="k">new</span> { p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice };
</pre>  
<p>This can be partially solved by using method that returns <code>Expression</code>, because method type
  parameters can be inferred, so you it wouldn't be needed to specify return type explicitly. The problem is 
  that in current preview type inference doesn't use information from lambda expression that you pass as parameter
  to method so this can't be done. The following code can't be currently compiled, but lets see whether this will
  be fixed in the future releases:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// Using this method you could declare Expression 
// variables that return anonymous type</span><br />
<span class="k">public</span> Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, A0&gt;&gt; CreateExpression&lt;T, A0&gt;
  (Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, A0&gt;&gt; expr)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> expr;
}
</pre>

<pre>
<span class="c">// Expression with anonymous return type! (unfortunatelly current 
// preview isn't able to infer type from the lambda expression)</span>  <br />
<span class="k">var </span>ret = CreateExpr( (Product p) =&gt; 
  <span class="k">new</span> { p.ProductName, Price = p.UnitPrice} );
</pre>

<p>The minor problem is that it is currently difficult to modify expression trees. There is a class called 
  <code>ExpressionVisitor</code> in the <code>System.Query.dll</code>, but it is currently internal. This class makes
  modification of expression trees quite simple, so hopefully it will be public in the future LINQ releases. 
  For now, I used Reflector to extract this class, because I didn't want to write the same class myself and I see 
  no reasons why the class shouldn't be public in the future.</p>

    <h4>Research and teaching</h4>
    <img src="http://tomasp.net/img/cam.png" alt="University of Cambride" style="float:right;margin:25px 0px 10px 10px;" />
    <p>I'm finishing PhD in computer science at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.
      I'm working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed 
      prog&shy;ramming or data-flow). See <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/">my academic page</a> for
      more.</p>
