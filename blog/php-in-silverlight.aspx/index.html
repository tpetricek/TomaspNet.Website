<h1>Writing Silverlight applications in PHP</h1>
<img src="/articles/php-in-silverlight/car_intro_sm.png" alt="Simple Silverlight App in PHP" style="margin:10px; float:left;"/>

<p>In my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/phalanger-future-notes.aspx">last post</a> about Phalanger I mentioned 
  that our important goal is to support the Silverlight (2.0) platform. Shortly Silverlight is a cross-browser 
  platform that can be used for developing client-side components that run in the web browser and contain
  rich media, graphics and can interactively communicate with the user. The language that can be used for
  writing Silverlight code can be in general any .NET language, so our goal is to allow using PHP by 
  making Phalanger compatible with Silverlight.</p>
<p>First steps were already made and it is becoming possible to write some very interesting things in 
  Silverlight using PHP, there is of course still a lot of work to do and we're discussing the future 
  development with PHP development team (you can join the mailing list <a href="http://news.php.net/php.on.dlr" type="external">PHP on DLR</a> for more info).
  In this article we will first show a very basic Silverlight example that uses PHP and later I will 
  shortly comment more complicated example - a game (quite addicting, so be careful :-)!) where you have to 
  fly with helicopter and avoid the walls. The source code for helicopter game is also attached, so feel free
  to modify it or create similar games!</p>
<p>If you can't wait to try the demos before looking at the sources, here are the links:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Introducing PHP for Silverlight</h2>
<p>An inevitable part of almost any Silverlight application is <em>XAML</em> file. XAML is a declarative
  language based on XML (which is in some ways similar to SVG) and is used for describing the user interface
  elements of the application - it is important to note that these elements are all represented by some
  object at runtime and so the XAML actually just creates instances of these objects. XAML can be used for
  defining basic graphical elements like shapes (<code>Ellipse</code>, <code>Rectangle</code>, ...), elements
  that can be used for grouping other elements (<code>Canvas</code>), but also animations. Animations
  are quite interesting, because they specify how properties of other object (specified using <code>Name</code>)
  should change when the animation runs. For example you can create an animation in XAML that moves object
  from position <code>[0, 0]</code> to <code>[100, 100]</code> in 100 seconds.</p>
  
<h3>XAML Source File</h3>  
<p>The following XAML sample contains part of the declarative markup used to create the car that you can see 
  in the screenshot above. The live version of the example can be found <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/php-in-silverlight/simplegui.html" type="external">here</a>.
  The sample application contains an HTML file with some JavaScript that initializes the Silverlight component
  (you can download them below and analyze them yourself). When the Silverlight component is initialized the 
  XAML file is loaded and this is where the Silverlight application starts executing.
  Let's now look at the structure of <code>simplegui.xaml</code> file:</p>  
  
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;Canvas x:Name="parentCanvas"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007" 
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" 
    xmlns:php="clr-namespace:PHP.Silverlight;assembly=ClientBin/PhpNetCore.dll"
    Width="800" Height="600" Background="White" &gt;
  &lt;!-- Specifies the PHP code that drives the application --&gt;
  &lt;php:PhalangerLoader Source="Simplegui.phpx" /&gt;

  &lt;Canvas.Resources&gt;
    &lt;!-- Animation that moves the car object --&gt;
    &lt;Storyboard x:Name="moveCar"&gt;
      &lt;DoubleAnimation From="0" To="810" Duration="0:0:2" 
                       Storyboard.TargetName="carCanvas" 
                       Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Canvas.Left)"/&gt;
    &lt;/Storyboard&gt;
    &lt;!-- (...) more animations --&gt;
  &lt;/Canvas.Resources&gt;

  &lt;!-- Car - composed from ellipses and rectangles --&gt;
  &lt;Canvas x:Name="carCanvas"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Back wheel --&gt;
    &lt;Ellipse x:Name="wheel1" Width="47" Height="47" Stroke="#FF000000" 
             Canvas.Left="5" Canvas.Top="228" /&gt;
    &lt;!-- (...) other car parts --&gt;
  &lt;/Canvas&gt;  
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
</pre>
<p>There are a few important things to note. First, the whole content is contained in a <code>Canvas</code>
  element, which is a container for other elements. The root element contains several standard <code>xmlns</code>
  declarations and also <code>xmlns:php="..."</code>, which imports element that will be later used to 
  load PHP code. In the XML namespace declaration we have to specify the path to the Phalanger Core assembly
  (called <code>PhpNetCore.dll</code>). Later, the <code>php:PhalangerLoader</code> element is used to specify
  what PHP source file is attached to the application - this will be in more details discussed shortly.</p>
<p>Other interesting element in the file is <code>Canvas.Resources</code>. This element specifies resources of the
  root canvas and in our example contains animation declarations. The animation is created using <code>Storyboard</code>
  element, which we will later retrieve from the resources using the <code>Name</code> attribute and start 
  from our PHP code. The storyboard can contain several animations that specify how some attribute of other object 
  should change - in this example we have a single <code>DoubleAnimation</code>, which linearly animates a floating
  point value from <code>0</code> to <code>810</code>. The property that will be changed during the animation
  is <code>Canvas.Left</code> (the position of the shape from left relatively to the parent <code>Canvas</code> object)
  and the animated object is an object with name <code>carCanvas</code>. Finally, the last attribute (<code>Duration</code>)
  specifies that the animation should take 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Explaining everything that can be done just in XAML would make quite a long article alone, so I will not go in 
  further details in this article, though I will definitely mention a few more things in the future. Good reference
  with examples can be found in the MSDN Documentation for Silverlight [<a href="#phpinslref">1</a>]. Also, it is 
  possible to create XAML files in a graphical designer called <em>Expression Blend 2</em> [<a href="#phpinslref">2</a>], which is currently available 
  as a beta version. It doesn't directly support PHP projects, but you can use it to create XAML files that can be 
  later copied to your Phalanger-powered Silverlight applications.</p>  

<h3>PHPX Source File</h3>
<p>In this example, I use <code>phpx</code> as an extension for the client-side PHP code that will run in Silverlight.
  As you can see the file is referenced using file name from the XAML file and this also means that the source code is 
  downloaded from the server to the client and executed there. To make this possible the extension of client-side (Silverlight)
  PHP code has to be an extension that the web server will serve as a plain text (as an opposite to server-side PHP code
  which is executed by the web server). If your web hosting doesn't allow hosting of files with <code>phpx</code> extension you can 
  use for example <code>txt</code> and it will also work. </p>
<p>Let's now look at the PHP code file that controls the demo with a car (available <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/php-in-silverlight/simplegui.html" type="external">here</a>).
  The PHP file contains code that defines the interaction for our application, which is in this example very simple - when a user clicks on 
  the car we want to start the animation:</p>
<pre lang="php">
&lt;?
import namespace System:::Windows:::Input;
// Include common Silverlight utilities
include("slutils.phpx");

// Initialize canvas wrapper for working with the XAML elements
global $CANVAS;
global $cv;
$cv = new CanvasWrapper($CANVAS);

// Called when user clicks on the car
function OnClick() {
  global $cv;
  // Start the animation declared in XAML
  $cv-&gt;moveCar-&gt;Begin();
}

// Called when the Silverlight component loads in browser
function OnLoad() {
  global $cv;
  // Attach the event handler for 'MouseLeftButtonDown' of the 'carCanvas'
  $cv-&gt;carCanvas-&gt;MouseLeftButtonDown-&gt;Add
    (new MouseEventHandler("OnClick"));
}
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>On the first line, you can see the <code>import namespace</code> statement, which imports objects from the 
  specified .NET (Silverlight) namespace. This is a non-standard extension to the PHP language which is available
  in Phalanger to support namespaces (in the future the syntax will be same as syntax for working with namespaces in PHP 5.3).
  The second line includes a source file with various utilities that make developing Silverlight applications in PHP
  a lot easier - we will use only a single extension in this example, so I'll comment that shortly below.</p>
<p>The next few lines use a global variable <code>$CANVAS</code>, which is a special variable initialized by the
  Silverlight module in Phalanger. This variable refers to an object that represents the root canvas object created
  in XAML and it can be used for manipulating with other named elements in the XAML file (named elements have the 
  <code>x:Name</code> attribute). The variable <code>$cv</code> will be initialized to an object <code>CanvasWrapper</code>,
  which comes from the <code>slutils.phpx</code> file that I mentioned earlier. This class is a wrapper written in PHP 
  that simplifies the access to the canvas elements - it is working with the .NET representation of the canvas object,
  which has all the needed functionality, but the wrapper exposes this functionality in a more PHP-friendly style. 
  If you look at the <code>OnClick</code> method (which will be called by the system when user clicks on the car element)
  you can see a code that starts the animation, by calling <code>Begin</code> method of the <code>Storyboard</code> element
  declared in XAML. The following example demonstrates how the <code>CanvasWrapper</code> simplifies the code:</p>  
<pre lang="php">
// Using CanvasWrapper we can just access 
// 'moveCar' as a member using magical '__get'
$cv-&gt;moveCar-&gt;Begin();

// Without CanvasWrapper the element has to 
// be accessed using 'FindName' method
$cv-&gt;FindName("moveCar")-&gt;Begin();
</pre>
<p>There are of course some other tricks that the <code>slutils.phpx</code> implements, but this is the only one that 
  we needed in this example. The implementation of <code>OnClick</code> function is quite simple, so let's look at the
  remaining <code>OnLoad</code> function now. The function is called by Phalanger when the Silverlight component is loaded,
  so we use it here to register an <em>event handler</em> that will be called when user clicks on the car.</p>
<p>To do this, we first access the <code>carCanvas</code> element from the XAML file and we'll use its <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code>
  property, which represents the event. Events are general .NET concept and can be used thanks to Phalanger, which
  understands events and knows how to use them. To register a new <em>event handler</em> that will be called when the 
  event occurs, we use the <code>Add</code> method and give it a corresponding event handler object as an argument. 
  In this case we're working with mouse-related events, so we have to create <code>MouseEventHandler</code> object
  (which comes from the <code>System:::Windows:::Input</code> namespace). When creating the event handler you can 
  give it either a reference to a global function (as a string) or a reference to a member function, in which case
  you would give it the following argument: <code>array($this, "FuncName")</code>.</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>The last thing that I wanted to comment in this article is the deployment process - that is what you need
  to upload to your web server when you want to host Silverlight applications in PHP. The Silverlight plugin is 
  installed on the client-side, so you can host it on any server using any server-side technology (both IIS and Apache
  are fine and you don't even need PHP on the server). The client-side Silverlight application consists of <code>xaml</code>
  file, <code>phpx</code> file and <code>html</code> with <code>js</code> files that contain the hosted 
  Silverlight control. The JavaScript code that initializes the control can be just copied from any other Silverlight
  application, so you just need to modify the <code>html</code> and <code>js</code> files to load the correct <code>xaml</code>
  file (or replace them with more complex server-side code, for example in PHP). </p>
<p>The <code>phpx</code> file has to be published as a text file, so that the source code can be downloaded to the
  client and compiled and executed there. You can however change the extension (for example to <code>txt</code>) if
  your web hosting doesn't allow <code>phpx</code> extension. You should be aware of the fact that the source code
  of the client-side part of your application is available to the users and you shouldn't put any security critical
  information in this file. This is a by-design limitation, because even if we allowed serving the client-side functionality
  in a compiled file it would be still possible to decompile the source code relatively easily. I will comment the
  security more in one of the future articles, where we get to sending data from client-side (PHP running in the 
  Silverlight) to the server-side (standard PHP application running on the server).</p>  
<p>Finally, the Silverlight has to be installed on the client and you need to upload Phalanger core libraries that 
  will execute the <code>phpx</code> file on the client. Currently, the two files are <code>PhpNetCore.dll</code> and
  <code>PhpNetClassLibrary.dll</code> - the first one contains the PHP compiler and core runtime and the second one
  implements common PHP functions. These files have to be in same directory and the <code>PhpNetCore.dll</code> have to 
  be referenced from the <code>xaml</code> file (default and recommended location for both of them is <code>ClientBin</code>
  subdirectory). I believe that these two files are cached by the browser when they are downloaded, but we 
  still want to make them as small as possible, so expect that the files together will be smaller than 1MB in a near future
  (in a far feature we'd like to leverage of some DLR capabilities, so the files should get even smaller).</p>

<h2>Helicopter Game</h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at very simple example where we used XAML to define the user interface elements and animations
  declaratively and we've used the PHP language (thanks to the Phalanger compiler and runtime) to implement interaction
  logic for the sample Silverlight application. I will write more about using PHP with Silverlight in the future
  (let me know if there is some topic that you're in particular interested!), but I also wanted to publish some 
  more complex, so you have a more sample code to look at if you want to play with PHP in Silverlight:</p>
  
<div style="text-align:center;">
<a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/php-in-silverlight/game.html" target="_blank"><img src="/articles/php-in-silverlight/copter_sm.png" alt="Go to the helicopter game" style="border:0px;margin:5px;"/></a><br />
<small><a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/php-in-silverlight/game.html" type="external">Go to the helicopter game</a></small>
</div>

<p>The helicopter game uses the concepts introduced in this article (event handlers and the <code>CanvasWrapper</code> object).
  The rest of the code uses standard PHP programming practices, so it should look quite familiar 
  to any PHP programmer. I believe that this article gives you a good introduction to writing client-side Silverlight 
  applications in PHP!</p>

    <img src="http://tomasp.net/img/cam.png" alt="University of Cambride" style="float:right;margin:25px 0px 10px 10px;" />
    <p>I submitted my PhD thesis at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>,
      working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed 
      prog&shy;ramming or data-flow). See <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/">my academic page</a> for
      more.</p>
