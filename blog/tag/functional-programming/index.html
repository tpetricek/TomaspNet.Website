  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/typed-revisited/index.html">In the age of the web: Typed functional-first programming revisited</a></h1>
  <p>Most programming languages were designed before the age of web.
This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional 
language designers tak for granted. For example, programs do not run in a 
<em>closed world</em>, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable) 
services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven, 
and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments like JavaScript
libraries.</p>

<p>How can statically-typed programming languages adapt to the modern world?
In this article, I look at one possible answer that is inspired by the F# 
language and various F# libraries. In F#, we use <em>type providers</em> for 
integration with external information sources and for integration with untyped
programming environments. We use <em>lightweight meta-programming</em> for targeting 
JavaScript and <em>computation expressions</em> for writing asynchronous code.</p>

<p>This blog post is a shorter version of a <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/age-of-web/">ML workshop paper</a>
that I co-authored earlier this year and you should see this more as a position
statement. I'm not sure if F# and the solutions shown here are the best ones,
but I think they highlight very important questions in programming language 
design that I very much see as unsolved.</p>

<p>The article has two sections. First, I'll go through a simple case study showing
how F# can be used to build a client-side web widget. Then, I'll discuss some
of the implications for programming language design based on the example.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/index.html">Comparing date range handling in C# and F#</a></h1>
  <p>I was recently working on some code for handling date ranges in 
<a href="http://github.com/blueMountainCapital/Deedle">Deedle</a>. Although Deedle is written in F#, 
I also wrote some internal integration code in C#. After doing that, I realized that the 
code I wrote is actually reusable and should be a part of Deedle itself and so I went through
the process of rewriting a simple function from (fairly functional) C# to F#. This is a small
(and by no means representative!) example, but I think it nicely shows some of the reasons why
I like F#, so I thought I'd share it.</p>

<p>One thing that we are adding to Deedle is a "BigDeedle" implementation of internal data 
structures. The idea is that you can load very big frames and series without actually loading
all data into memory.</p>

<p>When you perform slicing on a large series and then merge some of the parts of the series
(say, years 2010, 2012 and 2014), you end up with a series that combines a
couple of chunks. If you then restrict the series (say, from June 2012 to June 2014), you
need to restrict the ranges of the chunks:</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/drawing.png" alt="Demonstration" style="margin:15px; width:370px" />

<p>As the diagram shows, this is just a matter of iterating over the chunks, keeping those 
in the range, dropping those outside of the range and restrictingthe boundaries of the other
chunks. So, let's start with the C# version I wrote.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/query-translation/index.html">Writing custom F# LINQ query builder</a></h1>
  <p>One of the attendees of my <a href="http://www.fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">virtual F# in Finance course</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/stuart_j_davies">Stuart</a> recently asked me a pretty advanced question about writing custom queries with F#, because he was 
interested in writing a nicer querying library for Amazon DynamoDB (his <a href="https://github.com/stuartjdavies/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/blob/master/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/DynamoDB.fs">project is here</a>).</p>

<p>I realized that I don't really know about any good resource about doing this, so I wrote a little sample
that shows how you can do this. The idea is that we want to be able to write something like this:</p>

<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span>
<span class="l">2: </span>

<p>The <code>DynamoDB</code> could even be a type generated by a type provider (with all the tables available in Dynamo DB).
Now, the above example uses the built-in <code>query</code> builder, which is extensible, but, as far as I know, you have to 
use LINQ expression trees to support it. In this article, I'm going to use an alternative approach with custom
builder (so you would write <code>dynamo { ... }</code> instead of <code>query { ... }</code>).</p>

<p>I wanted to write a minimal example showing how to do this, so this blog post is going to be mostly code 
(unlike my other chatty articles!), but it should give you (and Stuart :-)) some idea how to do this. 
I was quite intrigued by the idea of having a nice query language for DynamoDB, so I'm hoping that this
blog post can help move the project forward!</p>

<div class="tip" id="abs177_1">val query : Linq.QueryBuilder<br /><br />Full name: Microsoft.FSharp.Core.ExtraTopLevelOperators.query</div>
<div class="tip" id="abs177_2">val p : People</div>
<div class="tip" id="abs177_3">type DynamoDB =<br />&#160;&#160;static member People : seq&lt;People&gt;<br /><br />Full name: Query-translation_.DynamoDB</div>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/csharp-pattern-matching/index.html">Pattern matching in action using C# 6</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/csharp-pattern-matching/hat.png" style="float:right;margin:20px" />

<p>On year ago, on this very day, <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/csharp-6-released/index.html">I wrote about the open-sourcing of C# 
6.0</a>. Thanks to a very special
information leak, I learned about this about a week before Microsoft officially announced
it. However, my information were slightly incorrect - rather then releasing the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/">much 
improved version of the language</a>, Microsoft
continued working on language version internally called "Small C#", which is now available
as "C# 6" in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2015-vs.aspx">Visual Studio 2015 preview</a>.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that, with this release, Microsoft is secretly testing the reaction of the 
developer audience to some of the amazing features that F# developers loved and used for 
the last 7 years and that are coming to C# <em>very soon</em>. To avoid shock, these are however
carefuly hidden!</p>

<p>In this blog post, I'm going to show you <em>pattern matching</em> which is probably the most useful
hidden C# feature and its improvements in C# 6. For reasons that elude me, pattern matching in 
C# 6 is called <em>exception filters</em> and has some unfortunate restrictions. But we can still 
use it to write nice functional code!</p>

<p>Since I <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/544531884030840832">submitted my PhD thesis in December</a>,
I had a little bit of time to finish some of the things that I wanted to do for a really long time, but
never quite found time to actually do them. This included <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/mac-and-linux.html">getting the R provider to work on 
Mac</a> and also creating a new 
web site for my various functional programming trainings and books. I even have a nice domain name:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.functional-programming.net">www.functional-programming.net</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The page also discusses a couple of business reasons for looking into functional programming. So, if you're
a business person wondering why you should send your developers on an F# course, the site has the answers
for you too! (Or if you are developer and need a page for your boss.) The other place to check out is the
official <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation web page</a> is another great resource and the
<a href="http://fsharp.org/testimonials/">testimonials hosted there</a>.</p>

<p>The page has some information about the <a href="http://functional-programming.net/#trainings">various trainings we're offering at fsharpWorks</a>
and about the two F# books I co-authored (<a href="http://functional-programming.net/rwfp/">Real-World Functional Programming</a> and 
brand new <a href="http://functional-programming.net/deepdives/">F# Deep Dives</a>). 
I'm happy that we can offer some special deals on both the books and the F# FastTrack course in London, 
so if you're considering getting into F#, now is a good time!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/index.html">Library patterns: Why frameworks are evil</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/diagram-narrow.png" style="float:right;margin:25px 0px 25px 20px" />

<p>This article is a follow up to my previous blog post about <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers">functional library 
design</a>, but you do not need to read the previous one,
because I'll focus on a different topic.</p>

<p>In the previous article, I wrote about a couple of principles that I find useful when 
designing libraries in a functional style. This follows from my experience with building
F# libraries, but the ideas are quite general and can be useful in any programming language.
Previously, I wrote how <em>multiple layers of abstraction</em> let you build libraries that make
80% of scenarios easy while still supporting the more interesting use cases.</p>

<p>In this article, I'll focus on two other points from the list - how to design <em>composable</em>
libraries and how (and why) to <em>avoid callbacks</em> in library design. As the title suggests, this
boils down to one thing - build <strong>libraries</strong> rather than <strong>frameworks</strong>!</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers/layers.png" style="float:right;margin:15px 0px 15px 10px" />

<p>Over the last few years, I created or contributed to a number of libraries including 
<a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data">F# Data</a> for data access,
<a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> for exploratory data science with C# and F#,
Markdown parser and code-formatter <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/">F# Formatting</a>
and other fun libraries such as one for composing 3D objects <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/">used in my Christmas blog 
post</a>.</p>

<p>Building libraries is a fun and challenging task - even if we ignore all the additional things
that you need to get right such as testing, documentation and building (see <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/great-open-source/">my earlier blog
post</a>) and focus just on the API design.
In this blog post (or perhaps a series), I'll share some of the things I learned when trying 
to answer the question: What should a good library look like?</p>

<p>I was recently watching Mark Seemann's course <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/01/22/a-functional-architecture-with-f/">A Functional architecture with F#</a>,
which is a great material on designing functional <em>applications</em>. But I also realised that not much
has been written on designing functional <em>libraries</em>. For some aspect, you can use functional patterns
like monads (see <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6120-functional-programming-design-patterns-with-scott-wlaschin">Scott Wlaschin's presentation</a>),
but this only answers a part of the question - it tells you how to design individual types, but
not an entire library...</p>

<p>I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resolution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!</p>

<p>Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">F# in Finance</a> and our
<a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html">FastTrack to F#</a> course in London and New York
and also the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">F# Deep Dives</a> book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the

<p>This blog post is a part of the awesome <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2014/">F# Advent Calendar</a>
(see the previous entry about <a href="http://richardminerich.com/2014/12/developing-an-algorithm-in-f-fast-rotational-alignments-with-gospers-hack/">writing algorithms in F#</a>
from Rick Minerich), so it inevitably needs a Christmassy theme. However, there is also 
going to be a serious theme for the blog post, which is domain-specific languages.</p>

<p>One of my favorite examples of Domain-Specific Languages is a simple OpenGL library
that I wrote some time ago for composing 3D graphics in F#. You can see it in my 
NDC 2014 talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/97315970">Domain Specific Languages, the functional way</a>
and I also used it for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/puzzling-fsharp/index.html">Solving Puzzles with F#</a>
earlier on this blog.</p>

<p>The nice thing about the library is that it is very simple, but is rich enough to demonstrate
all the important concepts. In fact, the library is so easy to use that <a href="https://twitter.com/ptrelford/status/538098139430137856">even 8 years old can
do a talk about it</a>. So, if you're
spending Christmas with your family, perhaps you can go through this article with your children!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/index.html">Stateful computations in F# with update monads</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/code.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;width:200px" />

<p>Most discussions about monads, even in F#, start by looking at the well-known standard 
monads for handling state from Haskell. The <em>reader</em> monad gives us a way to propagate 
some read-only state, the <em>writer</em> monad makes it possible to (imperatively) produce 
values such as logs and the <em>state</em> monad encapsulates state that can be read and changed.</p>

<p>These are no doubt useful in Haskell, but I never found them as important for F#.
The first reason is that F# supports state and mutation and often it is just easier
to use a mutable state. The second reason is that you have to implement three 
different computation builders for them. This does not fit very well with the F# style
where you need to name the computation explicitly, e.g. by writing <code>async { ... }</code>
(See also my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl">recent blog about the F# Computation Zoo paper</a>).</p>

<p>When visiting the Tallinn university in December (thanks to James Chapman, Juhan Ernits 
& Tarmo Uustalu for hosting me!), I discovered the work on <em>update monads</em> by Danel Ahman 
and Tarmo Uustalu on <a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/types13.pdf">update monads</a>, which elegantly unifies <em>reader</em>, <em>writer</em> and 
<em>state</em> monads using a single abstraction.</p>

<p>In this article, I implement the idea of <em>update monads</em> in F#. Update monads are 
parameterized by <em>acts</em> that capture the operations that can be done on the state.
This means that we can define just a single computation expression <code>update { ... }</code> 
and use it for writing computations of all three aforementioned kinds.</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/csharp-6-released/csharp.jpg" style="width:170px;float:right;margin:15px" />

<p>At last, the long wait is finally over! After 4 years of waiting, the fully managed implementation
of the C# compiler [codenamed "Roslyn"][roslyn] has been finally released. In the recent months, 
"Roslyn" has been slowly turning into [vaporware][vaporware], but thanks to the recent breakthrough,
the team made an enormous progress over the last two months and even implemented a number of new
C# 6.0 features.</p>

<p>The C# 6.0 compiler, together with <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#compiler/3.1/Nov2013/src/">the full source code</a> has been released today!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In case you are reading this article later than on the day when it was
published, let me just point out that this was released on 1 April 2014. Just to 
avoid any disappointments. Have fun ;-).</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/puzzling-fsharp/index.html">Solving fun puzzles with F#</a></h1>
  <p>Do you need to convince your friends & family that programming can be fun? 
For the last Christmas, I got a puzzle as a gift. It is a number of small
cubes, joined together, that can be rotated and folded to form a bigger
(4x4x4) cube.</p>

<p>We spent the last few days of the year with family and a couple of friends
and I left the puzzle on the table. Every time I walked around, someone was
playing with it without much success. In the end, I said that if noone solves
it until 31 December, I'll write a program to do it. Which I did between 7 PM
and 8 PM and, voilà, here is what I got...</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/index.html">Coeffects: The next big programming challenge</a></h1>
  <p>Many advances in programming language design are driven by some practical motivations.
Sometimes, the practical motivations are easy to see - for example, when they come from
some external change such as the rise of multi-core processors. Sometimes, discovering 
the practical motivations is a tricky task - perhaps because everyone is used to a 
certain way of doing things that we do not even <em>see</em> how poor our current solution is.</p>

<p>The following two examples are related to the work done in F# (because this is what
I'm the most familiar with), but you can surely find similar examples in other languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-core</strong> is an easy to see challenge caused by an external development. 
It led to the popularity of <em>immutable</em> data structures (and functional programming,
in general) and it was also partly motivation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233250.aspx" title="Asynchronous Workflows (F#)">asynchronous workflows</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data access</strong> is a more subtle challenge. Technologies like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx" title="LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)">LINQ</a> make it
significantly easier, but it was not easy to see that inline SQL was a poor solution.
This is even more the case for F# <em>type providers</em>. You will not realize how poor the
established data access story is until you <em>see</em> something like
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCuGgA9Yqrs" title="F# R Type Provider Demo">WorldBank and R provider</a> or <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html" title="F# Data: CSV type provider">CSV type provider</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the next important practical challenge for programming language designers
is of the kind that is not easy to see - because we are so used to doing things in 
certain ways that we cannot see how poor they are. The problem is designing languages
that are better at working with (and understanding) the <em>context</em> in which programs are
executed.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl/index.html">The F# Computation Expression Zoo (PADL'14)</a></h1>
  <p>F# <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233182.aspx">computation expressions</a> are the 
syntactic language mechanism that is used by features like sequence expressions and asynchronous
workflows. The aim of F# computation expressions is to provide a <em>single</em> syntactic mechanism
that provides convenient notation for writing a wide range of computations.</p>

<p>The syntactic mechanisms that are unified by computation expressions include Haskell <code>do</code> 
notation and list comprehensions, C# iterators, asynchronous methods and LINQ queries,
Scala <code>for</code> comprehensions and Python generators to name just a few.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I started working on an academic article to explain what makes computation
expressions unique - and I think there is quite a few interesting aspects. Sadly, this is 
often not very well explained and so the general perception is more like this...</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/tuples-in-csharp/index.html">How many tuple types are there in C#?</a></h1>
  <p>In a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711">recent StackOverflow question</a>
the poster asked about the difference between <em>tupled</em> and <em>curried</em> form of a function in F#. 
In F#, you can use pattern matching to easily define a function that takes a tuple as an argument.
For example, the poster's function was a simple calculation that multiplies the number 
of units sold <em>n</em> by the price <em>p</em>:</p>
<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_1', 1)" class="i">salesTuple</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 2)" class="i">price</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 3)" class="i">count</span>) <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 4)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_4', 5)" class="i">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 6)" class="i">count</span>)</pre>
<p>The function takes a single argument of type <code>Tuple&lt;float, int&gt;</code> (or, using the nicer F# notation
<code>float * int</code>) and immediately decomposes it into two variables, <code>price</code> and <code>count</code>. The other
alternative is to write a function in the <em>curried</em> form:</p>
<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_5', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_5', 7)" class="i">salesCurried</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 8)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 8)" class="i">price</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 9)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 9)" class="i">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 10)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 10)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_4', 11)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_4', 11)" class="i">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 12)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 12)" class="i">count</span>)</pre>
<p>Here, we get a function of type <code>float -&gt; int -&gt; float</code>. Usually, you can read this just as a 
function that takes <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> and returns <code>float</code>. However, you can also use <em>partial
function application</em> and call the function with just a single argument - if the price of
an apple is $1.20, we can write <code>salesCurried 1.20</code> to get a <em>new</em> function that takes just
<code>int</code> and gives us the price of specified number of apples. The poster's question was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So when I want to implement a function that would have taken <em>n > 1</em> arguments, 
should I for example always use a curried function in F# (...)? Or should I take 
the simple route and use regular function with an n-tuple and curry later on 
if necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711#18721711">my answer on StackOverflow</a>.
The point of this short introduction was that the question inspired me to think about how
the world looks from the C# perspective...</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/types-and-maths/distributivity.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>One of the most amazing aspects of mathematics is that it applies to such a wide range 
of areas. The same mathematical rules can be applied to completely different objects 
(say, forces in physics or markets in economics) and they work exactly the same way.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look at one such fascinating use of mathematics - we'll use 
elementary school algebra to reason about functional data types.</p>

<p>In functional programming, the best way to start solving a problem is to think about
the data types that are needed to represent the data that you will be working with.
This gives you a simple starting point and a great tool to communicate and
develop your ideas. I call this approach <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx">Type-First Development and I wrote about
it earlier</a>, so I won't repeat
that here.</p>

<p>The two most elementary types in functional languages are <em>tuples</em> (also called pairs 
or product types) and <em>discriminated unions</em> (also called algebraic data types, case 
classes or sum types). It turns out that these two types are closely related to 
<em>multiplication</em> and <em>addition</em> in algebra...</p>
