<p>I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resulution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!</p>

<p>Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">F# in Finance</a> and our
<a href="http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html">FastTrack to F#</a> course in London and New York
and also the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">F# Deep Dives</a> book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/why-fsharp-in-2015/index.html#courses">second section</a>).</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/glowing.gif" style="float:right;margin:20px; width:200px" /> 

<p>This blog post is a part of the awesome <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2014/">F# Advent Calendar</a>
(see the previous entry about <a href="http://richardminerich.com/2014/12/developing-an-algorithm-in-f-fast-rotational-alignments-with-gospers-hack/">writing algorithms in F#</a>
from Rick Minerich), so it inevitably needs a Christmassy theme. However, there is also 
going to be a serious theme for the blog post, which is domain-specific languages.</p>

<p>One of my favorite examples of Domain-Specific Languages is a simple OpenGL library
that I wrote some time ago for composing 3D graphics in F#. You can see it in my 
NDC 2014 talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/97315970">Domain Specific Languages, the functional way</a>
and I also used it for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/puzzling-fsharp/index.html">Solving Puzzles with F#</a>
earlier on this blog.</p>

<p>The nice thing about the library is that it is very simple, but is rich enough to demonstrate
all the important concepts. In fact, the library is so easy to use that <a href="https://twitter.com/ptrelford/status/538098139430137856">even 8 years old can
do a talk about it</a>. So, if you're
spending Christmas with your family, perhaps you can go through this article with your children!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/index.html">Stateful computations in F# with update monads</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/update-monads/code.png" style="float:right;margin:20px;width:200px" />

<p>Most discussions about monads, even in F#, start by looking at the well-known standard 
monads for handling state from Haskell. The <em>reader</em> monad gives us a way to propagate 
some read-only state, the <em>writer</em> monad makes it possible to (imperatively) produce 
values such as logs and the <em>state</em> monad encapsulates state that can be read and changed.</p>

<p>These are no doubt useful in Haskell, but I never found them as important for F#.
The first reason is that F# supports state and mutation and often it is just easier
to use a mutable state. The second reason is that you have to implement three 
different computation builders for them. This does not fit very well with the F# style
where you need to name the computation explicitly, e.g. by writing <code>async { ... }</code>
(See also my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl">recent blog about the F# Computation Zoo paper</a>).</p>

<p>When visiting the Tallinn university in December (thanks to James Chapman, Juhan Ernits 
&amp; Tarmo Uustalu for hosting me!), I discovered the work on <em>update monads</em> by Danel Ahman 
and Tarmo Uustalu on <a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/types13.pdf">update monads</a>, which elegantly unifies <em>reader</em>, <em>writer</em> and 
<em>state</em> monads using a single abstraction.</p>

<p>In this article, I implement the idea of <em>update monads</em> in F#. Update monads are 
parameterized by <em>acts</em> that capture the operations that can be done on the state.
This means that we can define just a single computation expression <code>update { ... }</code> 
and use it for writing computations of all three aforementioned kinds.</p>

"Roslyn" has been slowly turning into [vaporware][vaporware], but thanks to the recent breakthrough,
the team made an enormous progress over the last two months and even implemented a number of new
C# 6.0 features.</p>

<p>The C# 6.0 compiler, together with <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#compiler/3.1/Nov2013/src/">the full source code</a> has been released today!</p>

  <p>Do you need to convince your friends &amp; family that programming can be fun? 
For the last Christmas, I got a puzzle as a gift. It is a number of small
cubes, joined together, that can be rotated and folded to form a bigger
(4x4x4) cube.</p>

<p>We spent the last few days of the year with family and a couple of friends
and I left the puzzle on the table. Every time I walked around, someone was
playing with it without much success. In the end, I said that if noone solves
it until 31 December, I'll write a program to do it. Which I did between 7 PM
and 8 PM and, voilà, here is what I got...</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/index.html">Coeffects: The next big programming challenge</a></h1>
  <p>Many advances in programming language design are driven by some practical motivations.
Sometimes, the practical motivations are easy to see - for example, when they come from
some external change such as the rise of multi-core processors. Sometimes, discovering 
the practical motivations is a tricky task - perhaps because everyone is used to a 
certain way of doing things that we do not even <em>see</em> how poor our current solution is.</p>

<p>The following two examples are related to the work done in F# (because this is what
I'm the most familiar with), but you can surely find similar examples in other languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-core</strong> is an easy to see challenge caused by an external development. 
It led to the popularity of <em>immutable</em> data structures (and functional programming,
in general) and it was also partly motivation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233250.aspx" title="Asynchronous Workflows (F#)">asynchronous workflows</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data access</strong> is a more subtle challenge. Technologies like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx" title="LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)">LINQ</a> make it
significantly easier, but it was not easy to see that inline SQL was a poor solution.
This is even more the case for F# <em>type providers</em>. You will not realize how poor the
established data access story is until you <em>see</em> something like
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCuGgA9Yqrs" title="F# R Type Provider Demo">WorldBank and R provider</a> or <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/CsvProvider.html" title="F# Data: CSV type provider">CSV type provider</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the next important practical challenge for programming language designers
is of the kind that is not easy to see - because we are so used to doing things in 
certain ways that we cannot see how poor they are. The problem is designing languages
that are better at working with (and understanding) the <em>context</em> in which programs are
executed.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/computation-zoo-padl/index.html">The F# Computation Expression Zoo (PADL'14)</a></h1>
  <p>F# <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233182.aspx">computation expressions</a> are the 
syntactic language mechanism that is used by features like sequence expressions and asynchronous
workflows. The aim of F# computation expressions is to provide a <em>single</em> syntactic mechanism
that provides convenient notation for writing a wide range of computations.</p>

<p>The syntactic mechanisms that are unified by computation expressions include Haskell <code>do</code> 
notation and list comprehensions, C# iterators, asynchronous methods and LINQ queries,
Scala <code>for</code> comprehensions and Python generators to name just a few.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I started working on an academic article to explain what makes computation
expressions unique - and I think there is quite a few interesting aspects. Sadly, this is 
often not very well explained and so the general preception is more like this...</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/tuples-in-csharp/index.html">How many tuple types are there in C#?</a></h1>
  <p>In a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711">recent StackOverflow question</a>
the poster asked about the difference between <em>tupled</em> and <em>curried</em> form of a function in F#. 
In F#, you can use pattern matching to easily define a function that takes a tuple as an argument.
For example, the poster's function was a simple calculation that multiplies the number 
of units sold <em>n</em> by the price <em>p</em>:</p>
<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_1', 1)" class="i">salesTuple</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 2)" class="i">price</span>, <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 3)" class="i">count</span>) <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 4)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_4', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_4', 5)" class="i">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 6)" class="i">count</span>)</pre>
<p>The function takes a single argument of type <code>Tuple&lt;float, int&gt;</code> (or, using the nicer F# notation
<code>float * int</code>) and immediately decomposes it into two variables, <code>price</code> and <code>count</code>. The other
alternative is to write a function in the <em>curried</em> form:</p>
<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_5', 7)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_5', 7)" class="i">salesCurried</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 8)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 8)" class="i">price</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 9)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 9)" class="i">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_2', 10)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_2', 10)" class="i">price</span> <span class="o">*</span> (<span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_4', 11)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_4', 11)" class="i">float</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'abs159_3', 12)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'abs159_3', 12)" class="i">count</span>)</pre>
<p>Here, we get a function of type <code>float -&gt; int -&gt; float</code>. Usually, you can read this just as a 
function that takes <code>float</code> and <code>int</code> and returns <code>float</code>. However, you can also use <em>partial
function application</em> and call the function with just a single argument - if the price of
an apple is $1.20, we can write <code>salesCurried 1.20</code> to get a <em>new</em> function that takes just
<code>int</code> and gives us the price of specified number of apples. The poster's question was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So when I want to implement a function that would have taken <em>n > 1</em> arguments, 
should I for example always use a curried function in F# (...)? Or should I take 
the simple route and use regular function with an n-tuple and curry later on 
if necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18718232/when-should-i-write-my-functions-in-curried-form/18721711#18721711">my answer on StackOverflow</a>.
The point of this short introduction was that the question inspired me to think about how
the world looks from the C# perspective...</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/types-and-math.aspx/index.html">Power of mathematics: Reasoning about functional types</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/types-and-maths/distributivity.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>One of the most amazing aspects of mathematics is that it applies to such a wide range 
of areas. The same mathematical rules can be applied to completely different objects 
(say, forces in physics or markets in economics) and they work exactly the same way.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look at one such fascinating use of mathematics - we'll use 
elementary school algebra to reason about functional data types.</p>

<p>In functional programming, the best way to start solving a problem is to think about
the data types that are needed to represent the data that you will be working with.
This gives you a simple starting point and a great tool to communicate and
develop your ideas. I call this approach <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx">Type-First Development and I wrote about
it earlier</a>, so I won't repeat
that here.</p>

<p>The two most elementary types in functional languages are <em>tuples</em> (also called pairs 
or product types) and <em>discriminated unions</em> (also called algebraic data types, case 
classes or sum types). It turns out that these two types are closely related to 
<em>multiplication</em> and <em>addition</em> in algebra...</p>
