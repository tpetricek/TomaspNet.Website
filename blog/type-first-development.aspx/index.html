<h1>Why type-first development matters</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/tfd.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>Using functional programming language changes the way you write code in a number
of ways. Many of the changes are at a <em>small-scale</em>. For example, you learn how to express 
computations in a shorter, more declarative way using higher-order functions.
However, there are also many changes at a <em>large-scale</em>. The most notable one
is that, when designing a program, you start thinking about the (data) types 
that represent the data your code works with.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe this approach. Since the acronym TDD is already taken,
I call the approach Type-First Development (TFD), which is probably a better name anyway.
The development is not <em>driven</em> by types. It <em>starts</em> with types, but the rest of the
implementation can still use test-driven development for the implementation.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates the approach using a case study from a real life: 
My example is a project that I started working on with a friend who needed a 
system to log journeys with a company car (for expense reports). Using the 
type-first approach made it easier to understand and discuss the problem.</p>

<p>In many ways, TFD is a very simple approach, so this article just gives a name
to a practice that is quite common among functional and F# programmers (and 
we have been <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">teaching it at our F# trainings</a> for the last year).</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>Ideas for this article occurred to me when reading an interesting post 
on <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/incubator/blog/type-driven-design">type driven design</a>.
The article discusses quite different aspects of types, but it starts with an
inspiring quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When writing code in a statically typed language sometimes types are 
considered as orthogonal to the logic of the code. We write them to appease 
the compiler, or get performance or IntelliSense &amp; navigation, but all of 
these has no relation to the code itself.</p>

  <p>This is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do I use types when writing code in F#? First of all, I use them as a
useful notation for quickly and easily writing down ideas about program design
and as a specification of a program. And I believe this is the case for many
other F# programmers. In fact, this use of types is not limited to 
<em>statically-typed languages</em>. I think it applies similarly to other functional
langauges, although Scheme or LISP programmers would probably talk about
<em>data structures</em> instead of <em>types</em>.</p>

<h2>Case study: Journey log</h2>

<p>Let's start the article with an example. As I said earlier, this is based on a real
discussion that I had with a friend, so I will try to replay the discussion.
I was writing the F# code as we discussed, but I did not know much about the domain.
A friend understands the domain (and knows C# and some Haskell, but not F#, though
I believe the F# code should be understandable to less technical people too).</p>

<h3>Designing Journey log types</h3>

<p>The purpose of the application is to calculate how expensive were various car 
journeys, how much money was spent for different cars etc. However, the first
question is, what data the application processes? 
It needs to record date when a journey started, driver's name, total distance and, 
most importantly, a list of refuelings. In F#, this can be written as the 
following (record) type:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft13', 17)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft13', 17)" class="i">Refueling</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span id="ftt14" onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft14', 18)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft14', 18, document.getElementById('ftt14'))" class="omitted">(...)</span>

<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft15', 19)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft15', 19)" class="i">Journey</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
  { <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft16', 20)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft16', 20)" class="i">Start</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft17', 21)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft17', 21)" class="i">DateTime</span> 
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft18', 22)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft18', 22)" class="i">Driver</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft19', 23)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft19', 23)" class="i">string</span>
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft20', 24)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft20', 24)" class="i">Distance</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 25)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 25)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft3', 26)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft3', 26)" class="i">km</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft21', 27)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft21', 27)" class="i">Refueling</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft22', 28)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft22', 28)" class="i">list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft21', 29)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft21', 29)" class="i">Refueling</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> }</pre>


<p>At this point, we do not know what <code>Refueling</code> represents, but we could already
define a type representing <code>Journey</code>. Note that I use a type <code>float&lt;km&gt;</code> for distance - 
this is using F# <em>units of measure</em>, which make it possible to attach unit information
to types (and check them at compile time), but it also serves as a useful documentation.</p>

<p>The next question is, what information does the application have about refuelings?
In other words, what is the declaration of the <code>Refueling</code> type. Here, the story is 
more interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can fill the tank (in which case we want to log the amount and the price)</li>
<li>We can fill a canister (and we need to log the same information as in the previous point)</li>
<li>We can use a canister (in which case we log everything except for a price)</li>
</ul>

<p>For all refuelings, we need to log the state of the total kilometer counter 
(showing the total number of kilometers traveled so far in the car) and fuel
(in some cars you can combine biodiesel and diesel, etc.) This leads us to the
following F# type declarations:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft23', 30)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft23', 30)" class="i">RefuelingKind</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
  | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft24', 31)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft24', 31)" class="i">FillTank</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft6', 32)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft6', 32)" class="i">PricePerUnit</span>
  | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft25', 33)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft25', 33)" class="i">FillCanister</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft6', 34)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft6', 34)" class="i">PricePerUnit</span>
  | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft26', 35)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft26', 35)" class="i">UseCanister</span>

<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft27', 36)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft27', 36)" class="i">Refueling</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
  { <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft28', 37)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft28', 37)" class="i">Counter</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 38)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 38)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft3', 39)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft3', 39)" class="i">km</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft29', 40)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft29', 40)" class="i">Fuel</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft29', 41)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft29', 41)" class="i">Fuel</span>
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft30', 42)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft30', 42)" class="i">Amount</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 43)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 43)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft4', 44)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft4', 44)" class="i">litre</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft31', 45)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft31', 45)" class="i">Kind</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft23', 46)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft23', 46)" class="i">RefuelingKind</span> }</pre>


<p>For the <code>Refueling</code> type is again written as a record that combines all information we want
to keep for every refueling. The specific details are captured by <code>RefuelingKind</code>. This is
an F# discriminated union - a type that can have <em>either</em> <code>FillTank</code> value, <code>FillCanister</code> value
or <code>UseCanister</code> value. For the first two cases, we need to keep the price per litre. 
The two remaining types, <code>Fuel</code> and <code>PricePerUnit</code> can be defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft32', 47)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft32', 47)" class="i">PricePerUnit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 48)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 48)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft5', 49)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft5', 49)" class="i">GBP</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft4', 50)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft4', 50)" class="i">litre</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft33', 51)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft33', 51)" class="i">Fuel</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
  | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft9', 52)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft9', 52)" class="i">Biodiesel</span> | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft10', 53)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft10', 53)" class="i">Diesel</span> | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft11', 54)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft11', 54)" class="i">LPG</span> | <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft12', 55)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft12', 55)" class="i">Gasoline</span></pre>


<p>The <code>PricePerUnit</code> type is a type alias specifying that price is measured in GBP per litre.
Again, we can use F# units of measure to capture this additional information (later in the
implementation, the compiler will check that we use the number correctly and, i.e. always 
multiply it by amount when calculating total price). The <code>Fuel</code> type is a simple 
discriminated union that simply lists the different fuels (although we might later want
to change it and make the system more extensible).</p>

<h3>Reading data types</h3>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/uml.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>What have we achieved so far? We described the <em>domain model</em> for the Journey log application
with less than 20 lines of code. When writing the code for the first time, I typed a few 
type declarations, explained them to my friend and he gave me feedback saying what was 
wrong with my first design. This means that the process was quite collaborative and
iterative.</p>

<p>If we were doing that on a whiteboard, we would probably draw diagram like the one on the
right. You can see that the F# types quite closely correspond to what you would draw as
a UML diagram (although the detailed meaning is a bit different).</p>

<p>However, there is one major benefit in writing the ideas down as <em>code</em>. The code is 
executable. As you develop the application, you will add documentation, evolve the code
in many ways, but the <em>core domain</em> can still stay as a reasonably short single file 
in your project and it will always be <em>in sync</em>. New developers joining the project
(or a person coming back to it after some time) can just read that single file and get
a very good idea about the project.</p>

<h3>Adding Journey log functionality</h3>

<p>The discussion so far was focused on types that are used to represent the <em>data</em> that the
application works with. However, type-first development is equally useful if we want to 
focus on the <em>behaviour</em>. What kind of operations we expect from the Journey log application?</p>

<p>One task that we need for producing expenses is to calculate how much was spent on 
individual fuels in a given month (or, perhaps an arbitrary date range). Another
important task is to calculate what the average prices per kilometer for LPG, Gasoline 
and other fuels are. In a type-first development, we start by writing the types of
the functions:</p>

<pre class="fssnip">
<span class="k">type</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft34', 56)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft34', 56)" class="i">JourneyLog</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft22', 57)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft22', 57)" class="i">list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="i">Journey</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="c">/// Calculate amount spent on fuel in a given period</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="i">reportExpenses</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="i">JourneyLog</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft17', 58)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft17', 58)" class="i">DateTime</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft35', 59)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft35', 59)" class="i">TimeSpan</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft8', 60)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft8', 60)" class="i">Fuel</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 61)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 61)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft5', 62)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft5', 62)" class="i">GBP</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="c">/// Calculate average price of fuel per kilometer traveled</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="i">averagePrice</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="i">JourneyLog</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft8', 63)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft8', 63)" class="i">Fuel</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft7', 64)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft7', 64)" class="i">float</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'ft5', 65)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'ft5', 65)" class="i">GBP</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="i">kilometer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></pre>


<p>The code first defines <code>JourneyLog</code> type, which represents a list of journeys. The operations
that work with journey log always take <code>JourneyLog</code> as their first argument.</p>

<p>The function <code>reportExpenses</code> takes <code>DateTime * TimeSpan</code>, which represents a date range and
the kind of <code>Fuel</code> we are interested in. The result is a price in pounds, represented 
as <code>float&lt;GBP&gt;</code>. Units of measure are again very useful - they clearly inform us that the
result is price (as opposed to, i.e. fuel consumption, which would be <code>float&lt;litre/kilometer&gt;</code>).
The function <code>averagePrice</code> takes journey log, fuel and calculates a price per kilometer 
(as specified by the type <code>float&lt;GBP / kilometer&gt;</code>).</p>

<h3>Reading function types</h3>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/type-first-development/flow.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>By looking at the type signature, you can get a reasonably good idea about what the 
operation might do (this is even more the case for higher-order functions as discussed 
in the <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/incubator/blog/type-driven-design">type driven design</a>
article).</p>

<p>One important aspect of function types is that they tell you what results you can 
get from what inputs (and how). The diagram on the right demonstrates this in a 
bit more complicated scenario. Aside from <code>JourneyLog</code>, we also have a type <code>ExpenseList</code>
that represents a list of expense reports.</p>

<p>If you have, somewhere in the program, a value of type <code>JourneyLog</code> and want to print
(obtain) the <code>Invoice</code>, the types tell you what you can do. First, you need to turn
<code>JourneyLog</code> into <code>ExpenseList</code> (using the function <code>calculateExpenses</code>) and then you
can obtain <code>Invoice</code> using <code>printInvoice</code>.</p>

<p>This is a fairly simple example, but it demonstrates an important fact. If you use
types to represent different data structures that your code uses, the types of 
functions tell you how you can process such data structures. When reading code, you
can often use function types to understand what is happening. For example, in the 
diagram, we can only go from <code>JourneyLog</code> to <code>ExpenseList</code>, so the function probably
only uses some of the information from journey log. However, it is worth storing the
result in a separate data type (<code>ExpenseList</code>), so the expense list is probably used
in a number of ways in the application.</p>

<h2>Type-First Development</h2>

<p>The example above demonstrated what I call type-first development (TFD). As discussed
earlier, I believe this is a method that many users of F# and similar languages 
(perhaps more Haskell than Scala) use in practice. Let me now describe a few key
points about this approach.</p>

<h3>1. TFD emphasizes and simplifies communication</h3>

<p>When you use TFD, you get a very simple specification or documentation for your software
system very early during the development process (without even starting Microsoft Word).
You get a short piece of code that you can discuss with your colleagues, send around
by email (which is a lot more difficult with diagrams).</p>

<p>I'm not saying that you'll be able to show type declarations to your senior management or
to the end users of your system, but you usually <em>can</em> show them to any technical person.
They might not be able to read the code themselves, but you can walk through the code
and explain it.</p>

<p>In summary, this means that TFD supports communication and collaboration
(perhaps in a developer-friendly way). The importance of communication is clear and
is emphasized by other techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a>.</p>

<h3>2. TFD enables quick prototyping</h3>

<p>The code that you need to write to get a complete list of definitions that model your
problem domain is very short (at least, in languages like F#). This means that you 
do not have to worry about doing it wrong. You can start by writing down some types 
and if you see they do not correspond to your domain, simply throw the first version away.</p>

<p>When you have <em>data types</em> describing your domain and <em>function types</em> describing the 
behaviour, you can start implementing some of the functions, but it is similarly easy
to write an incomplete, mock implementation just to have something you can test.</p>

<h3>3. TFD works well with testing</h3>

<p>This leads us to the next point. Type-first development (TFD) works very well with 
test-driven development (TDD). In some way, when writing types, we are writing only 
code that is necessary to write our first tests. Once we write the type of a function 
such as <code>averagePrice</code>, you can start writing tests for the function and based on these
tests, you can then fill-in the implementation of the function.</p>

<p>In fact, you can read <em>types</em> as very basic <em>tests</em>. The type of the <code>averagePrice</code>
function is a test checking that when you call the function with correct <code>JourneyLog</code> and
<code>Fuel</code>, it gives you some number representing price in GBP per kilometers. This is
very general test, but it gives us useful guarantees and we can continue by adding
other tests, verifying the behaviour for concrete journey logs.</p>

<h3>4. TFD supports extensibility</h3>

<p>Focusing on the types used to represent data makes it easier to add new functionality
later on during the development. Once we have the <code>JourneyLog</code> type, we can add new functions
that process it and calculate new statistics or reports from the data.</p>

<p>Writing such new processing functionality is quite easy, because new code is going
to be very localized. We do not need to modify any existing objects. We just write a
new function to process the data (possibly using some other functions that we already
have).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this article, I described a development style that often comes with functional
programming languages such as F#. It was partly inspired by a related article on 
<a href="http://www.tikalk.com/incubator/blog/type-driven-design">type driven design</a>,
but I discussed the topic from a different perspective - instead of looking at types
technically, I tried to highlight what they mean in practice, for the <em>development style</em>.</p>

<p>The key idea of the type-first development (TFD) is that we start designing and 
prototyping applications by writing the types they work with. In F#, this is done
by writing type declarations (using records and discriminated unions), but the same
methodology can work in other languages - even in dynamically typed ones.</p>

<p>As demonstrated by a simple case study, focusing on the types first gives you a very
powerful way to communicate and prototype ideas about design. Using types is very 
developer-friendly approach, but I believe that it is accessible to any somewhat 
technical person. Moreover, the methodology works well with test-driven development
style and it helps writing extensible code.</p>

<p>Of course, no one size fits all. There are clearly scenarios where TFD is not the 
right way. As mentioned, it is very developer centric and so if you need to work with
non-technical analysts or customers on a complex projects, approaches like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">behaviour-driven development (BDD)</a>
may be more relevant.</p>

    <p>I'm finishing PhD in computer science at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.
      I'm working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed 
      prog&shy;ramming or data-flow). See <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/">my academic page</a> for
