Library patterns: Why frameworks are evil
=========================================

This article is a follow up to my previous blog post about [functional library 
design](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers), but you do not need to read the previous one,
because I'll focus on a different topic.

In the previous article, I wrote about a couple of principles that I find useful when 
designing libraries in a functional style. This follows from my experience with building
F# libraries, but the ideas are quite general and can be useful in any programming language.
Previously, I wrote how _multiple layers of abstraction_ let you build libraries that make
80% of scenarios easy while still supporting the more interesting use cases.

In this article, I'll focus on two other points from the list - how to design _composable_
libraries and how (and why) to _avoid callbacks_ in library design. As the title suggests, this
boils down to one thing - build **libraries** rather than **frameworks**!


Frameworks vs. Libraries
------------------------

<img src="diagram-narrow.png" style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 20px" />

What is a difference between a framework and a library? The key difference is how you can use
them and what kind of code you need to write.

 * **Frameworks.** When using a framework, the framework is in charge of running the system. 
   It defines some extensibility points (interfaces) where you need to put your
   implementation. 

 * **Libraries.** When using a library, you are in charge of running the system. The library defines
   some points through which you can access it (functions and types) and your code can 
   call it as it needs.

You can see the difference in the diagram. A framework defines a structure that you have to 
fill, while library has some structure that you have to build around.

Of course, the separation between the two is not complete. Some components have aspects of both - 
you call it as a library, but it has some holes (e.g. an interface) that you have to fill.

Why are frameworks evil?
------------------------

If you look at the diagram above, you can already see some of the problems with frameworks. 
In this section, I'd like to say a few things about three of the problems (before looking
at ways to avoid those in the next section). 

### Frameworks do not compose

<img src="compose.png" style="float:right;margin:35px 0px 35px 10px" />

Perhaps the biggest and the most obvious problem with frameworks is that they cannot be composed.
When you have two frameworks, they both force you to fill in a specific hole. But there is usually
no way to fit one framework inside another (and it is usually not clear which one should be
the one on the outside and which one should be on the inside).

With libraries, the situation is different. You are in control, so your program can easily call
multiple libraries. This may have some cost - you may need to write more complex code around the
library end-points - but it is usually possible.

> they are wrapped. Can something similar be defined for frameworks? 

### Frameworks are hard to explore

Another big problem with frameworks is that they are difficult to test and explore. In F#,
it is very useful to load a library into F# Interactive and try running it with various 
inputs to see what the library does. For example you can use the web development library 
[Suave](http://suave.io/) to start a simple web server like this:

*)
// Reference the library & open namespaces
#r "Suave.0.25.0/lib/net40/Suave.dll"
open Suave.Web 
open Suave.Http
 
// Start a simple web server printing hello
startWebServer defaultConfig <| fun ctx -> async {
  let whoOpt = ctx.request.queryParam "who"
  let message = sprintf "Hello %s" (defaultArg whoOpt "world")
  return! ctx |> Successful.OK message }
(**
The snippet loads the library and then calls `startWebServer` with a default configuration
and a function to handle requests (the function gets the query parameter `who` and prints
a greeting).

This kind of usage is extremely useful, because it lets the user experiment with the library
quickly. You can try calling `startWebServer` with different kinds of parameters and see what
it does (or, for other functions, see what it returns).

Now, if you look back at my Suave example, you might be wondering whether this is a library (we call a function)
or a framework (we specify a function that is called). In fact, the above example demonstrates both aspects.
As I'll say later, this instance of "framework" structure is not actually a bad thing (see the sections
on callbacks and `async` below).

### Frameworks shape how you code

The next problem with frameworks is that they control the structure of your code. The typical example of 
this is when you are using a framework that requires you to inherit from some abstract base class and
implement specific methods. For example the [Game class in the XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game_members.aspx)
looks something like this (I know that XNA is dead, but the patter is used in other similar frameworks):

    [lang=csharp]
    class Game {
      abstract void Initialize();
      abstract void Draw(DrawingContext ctx);
      abstract void Update();
    }

In `Initialize`, you are supposed to load any resources that your game might need; `Update` is called
repeatedly to calculate the next state and `Draw` is called when the screen needs to be updated. The
interface is pretty much designed to an imperative programming model, so you'll end up writing something
like the next snippet. Here, we're writing a silly Mario game where Mario just slowly walks to the right:
*)
type MyGame() =
  inherit Xna.Game()
  let mutable x = 0
  let mutable mario = None

  override this.Initialize() = 
    mario <- Some(Image.Load("mario.png"))
  override this.Update() =
    x <- x + 1
  override this.Draw(ctx) =
    mario |> Option.iter (fun mario ->
      ctx.Draw(x, 0, mario))
(**
The structure of the framework does not make it particularly easy to write the code in a nice way. Here,
I just did the most direct possible implementation. The mutable field `x` represent Mario's location and
`mario` is an `option<Image>` value for storing the resource.

You might say that this would be nicer in C# (e.g. I had to use `option` value because all F# fields have
to be initialized), but that is only true if you ignore all checking. The fact that we use `option` value
is actually making the code safer (because we cannot accidentally use `mario` in `Draw` if it was not 
initialized). Or does the framework _guaratnee_ that `Initialize` will be called before `Draw`? Well, how
are we supposed to know that?

How to avoid framework smells
-----------------------------

I hope I convinced you that you should avoid building _frameworks_ and create _libraries_ instead. But I
did not give any concrete tips how to do that. In the rest of the article, I look at a couple of concrete
points.

### Support interactive exploration

Even if you're not writing your library in F#, you should use F# Interactive to be able to call it 
interactively! F# is not just [great for documenting your library](http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold/writing-docs.html),
but writing an interactive script is a great way to make sure that your library is easy to call (if you're
on the .NET platform, the other option is [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net/)).

To give two examples of what I mean, the following snippet shows how you can use the [F# Formatting 
library](http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) to turn a folder with documentation containing
F# Script files and Markdown documents into HTML, or how to process a single file:
*)
#r "FSharp.Literate.dll"
open FSharp.Literate

// Process an entire folder
Literate.ProcessDirectory("C:/demo/docs")

// Process two individual documents
Literate.ProcessMarkdown("C:/demo/docs/sample.md")
Literate.ProcessScriptFile("C:/demo/docs/sample.fsx")
(**
The idea is that you just need to reference the library, open the namespace and find the `Literate` 
type as the entry-point. Once you have that, you can use "." and see what is available!

I think all good libraries should support this kind of usage. As another example, let's look at 
[FunScript](http://funscript.info/), which translates F# code to JavaScript. Typically, you'd use
this as part of some web framework, but it works just fine without that too. The following generates
JavaScript for simple async loop that increments the number in the page `<title>` every second:
*)
#r "FunScript.dll"
#r "FunScript.TypeScript.Binding.lib.dll"
open FunScript
open FunScript.TypeScript

Compiler.compile 
  <@@ let rec loop n : Async<unit> = async {
        Globals.window.document.title <- string n       
        do! Async.Sleep(1000)
        return! loop (n + 1) }
      loop 0 @@>
(**  
Again, we just reference the library (this time, we also reference bindings for DOM) and then we
call one function - the `compile` function takes an F# quotation. Once you discover it, you can
experiment with what kind of things it can handle! The above demo shows a nice support for the
F# `async { .. }` and for bindings that let you access the DOM.


### Use only simple callbacks

When I talked about frameworks in the theoretical side note above, I said that framework is, 
in principle, anything that accepts a function as an argument. So, am I saying that you should not
use higher-order functions? Of course not!

Compare the following two simple snippets - the first one uses the standard list processing 
functions and the second one reads some input (using the first function), validates it and 
then processes it (using the second function):
*)
// Standard list-processing functions
[ 1 .. 10 ]
|> List.filter (fun n -> n%3 = 0)
|> List.map (fun n -> n*10)

// Calls the first function to read input, validates 
// it and then calls second function to process it
readAndProcess
  (fun () -> File.ReadAllText("C:/demo.txt"))
  (fun s -> s.ToUpper())
(**
There are two differences between the first and second example. In case of list functions, you
always specify just a single function as an argument. Furthermore, the functions should never 
be stateful.

In the second case, we are specifying two functions. To me, this is a sign that the function may
be more complicated than it needs to be. Secondly, `readAndProcess` requires us to return `string`
state from the first function and then take `string` as the input of the second function. This is
another potential problem. What if we needed to pass some other state from the first function to
the second one?

I'm obviously looking at a simplified case here, but let's look what might be going on inside 
`readAndProcess`. The function might be handling some exceptions and checking that the input
is valid before calling the second argument:
*)
let readAndProcess readInput processInput =
  try
    let input = readInput()
    if input = null || input = "" then None
    else Some(processInput input)
  with :? System.IO.IOException -> None
(**
How can we improve this abstraction? First of all, the function really serves two purposes. First,
it handles exceptions (in a silly way, but this is a toy sample). Second, it validates the input.
We can split it into two functions:
*)
let ignoreIOErrors f =
  try Some (f())
  with :? System.IO.IOException -> None
let validateInput input = 
  if input = null || input = "" then None else Some(input)
(**
Now, `validateInput` became just an ordinary function that returns `Some` if the input was valid.
The `ignoreIOErrors` function still takes a function as an argument - in this case, it makes sense,
because exception handling is a typical example of the [Hole in the Middle pattern](http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2007/07/the-hole-in-the-middle-pattern/).
Using the new functions, we can write:
*)
ignoreIOErrors (fun () ->
  let input = File.ReadAllText("C:/demo.txt")
  validateInput input 
  |> Option.map (fun valid -> valid.ToUpper() ))
(**
If you try, you can still fit this on 3 lines, but the code is a bit longer and a bit more explicit.
However, I think that is actually a benefit, because you can see what is going on (and you can start
by calling `validateInput` interactively!) Also, if you like the `readAndProcess` function better, that's
fine - you can easily define it using the two above functions (but not the other way round!) So, your
library can provide _multiple levels of abstraction_ as [discussed in my earlier article](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers/).
But providing only the higher-level abstraction would be limiting.

To summarize, passing functions as arguments is not necessarily wrong, but be careful.
If a function takes more than one function as an argument, it might not be the best low-level
abstraaction. If the functions passed as arguments need to share and pass around some state, 
then you should definitely provide an alternative (in case the "default" state passing is
not what the caller needs).

### Inverting callbacks with events and async

When discussing how frameworks shape your code, I used a simple game enginge as an example.
What could be done differently so that we do not need to use mutable fields and implement
a specific class? In F#, we can use _asynchronous workflows_ and _event-based_ programming
model instead.

This is more tricky for languages that do not have anything similar to computation 
expressions (or [iterators that can be used to fake this](http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-async.aspx/)),
but C# supports `await`, F# has computation expressions, Haskell has the `do` notation and in 
Python you can probably misuse generators.

The idea is that rather than writing virtual methods that need to be implemented, we'll expose
events that are triggered when the operation needs to be done. So, the interface for our `Game`
might look like this:

    type Game = 
      member Update : IEvent<unit>
      member Draw : IEvent<DrawingContext>
      member IsRunning : bool

Using F# async, we can now write the code differently. Going back to the original idea of frameworks vs.
libraries, we can write it so that we are in control what is going on! The following first initializes
the resources and the `Game` object and then it implements a loop (using recursive `async` blocks) that
waits for either `Update` or `Draw` event using the [AwaitObservable](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.AsyncExtensions)
method:
*)
// Initialize game and resources
let game = Inverted.Game()
let mario = Image.Load("mario.png")

// Recursive loop that runs until the end of the game
let rec loop x = async {
  if game.IsRunning then
    let! evt = Async.AwaitObservable(game.Update, game.Draw) 
    match evt with 
    | Choice1Of2() -> 
        // Handle the 'Update' event
        return! loop (x + 1)
    | Choice2Of2(ctx) -> 
        // Handle the 'Draw' event
        ctx.Draw(x, 0, mario) 
        return! loop x }

// Start the Game with x=0
loop 0  
(**

We cannot be fully in control, because we don't know when the system calls us
to update the game state and when it calls us to redraw the screen. But we can be
in control when it comes to initializing the resources, checking when the game is
running and waiting for one or the other event. 

Using `async { .. }` is the key here. We can use `AwaitObservable` to say "resume
the computation when either `Update` or `Draw` is required". When the event happens,
we preform the required action (update state on line 12 or draw Mario on line 15)
and then continue. The nice thing is that you can easily extend this into a more
complex logic - for a nice example, see [Phil Trelford's Fractal Zoom](http://trelford.com/blog/post/FractalZoom.aspx).
The other option with similar properties would be to use [F# agents](http://www.developerfusion.com/article/139804/an-introduction-to-f-agents/),
which give you similar control over the logic.

So, we are now in control, but have we really gained much? If you're new to F#, 
then you'll no doubt find the above code confusing. The main thing is that, by reversing
the control, we can now easily write our own abstractions, which leads to the last point...

### Use multiple levels of abstraction

As discussed in the [previous blog post](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers/), a 
library should provide multiple layers of abstraction. The `Game` type that I used
in the previous snippet is a low-level abstraction - it is useful if you want to build
something more sophisticated and it gives you all the control you need. But most of
the time, you may actually want to write the game just as a pair of "draw" and "update"
functions.

This can easily be done, because we can just take the previous code snippet and extract
several parts into arguments:
*)
let startGame draw update init =
  let game = Inverted.Game()
  let rec loop x = async {
    if game.IsRunning then
      let! evt = Async.AwaitObservable(game.Update, game.Draw) 
      match evt with 
      | Choice1Of2() -> return! loop (update x)
      | Choice2Of2(ctx) -> 
          draw x ctx
          return! loop x }
  loop init
(**
The `startGame` abstraction takes two functions as arugments together with an initial state.
The `update` function updates the state and the `draw` function draws the state using the
specified `DrawingContext`. Using these, we can now write our Mario sample in just 4 lines:
*)
let mario = Image.Load("mario.png")
0 |> startGame 
  (fun x ctx -> ctx.Draw(x, 0, mario))
  (fun x -> x + 1)
(**
If you read the whole blog post, then you may be wondering whether I'm contradicting myself here!
Didn't I previously write that higher-order functions that take multiple functions (especially
when they share state) are evil frameworks? You're right, I said that! But let me clarify this:

_It is fine to have easy-to-use operation that takes a couple of other functions as a
high-level abstraction, but there sould be a simple and more explicit alternative!_

You can take the above 4 lines, look at the definition of `startGame` and turn them into the
14 lines of code we've seen earlier (excluding comments). So, you should be able to _get the control_
by taking one (not very deep) step under the cover. This is in contrast with building a fragile
scaffolding on top of a poorly designed library that is sometimes needed if you want to write
elegant code.

### Design composable libraries 

As I mentioned before, one of the main reasons why you should design libraries rather than 
frameworks is that libraries can be composed. If you are in control, you can choose which libraries
to use for which part of a problem. This might not always be easy, but with libraries, you at least 
have a chance!

I think there are no general rules on how to design libraries that compose well - perhaps one 
important point is that your types need to expose all important information that other libraries
(for similar purpose) would need if they wanted to create a similar data structure.

A good example here is [FsLab](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsLab), which is a package that
brings together a number of data-science libraries for F# (including [Deedle](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle),
[Math.NET Numerics](http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/) and others). The FsLab package comes with
a single script that links a number of other libraries together (you can [see the source code
here](https://github.com/tpetricek/FsLab/blob/2c1d81d0502f03331c21242e2cef9386d0928990/src/FsLab.fsx#L82)).

Two simple examples from the file are functions for converting from matrix to frame (`Matrix.toFrame`)
and the other way round (`Frame.toMatrix`):
*)
module Matrix =
  let inline toFrame matrix = 
    matrix |> Matrix.toArray2 |> Frame.ofArray2D

module Frame =
  let inline toMatrix frame = 
    frame |> Frame.toArray2D |> DenseMatrix.ofArray2
(**
The solution here is quite simple, because both Deedle frame and Math.NET matrices can be converted
to/from a 2D array and so we just need to go from one to the other through an array. This looks very
simple, but I think that's the point - no matter what your library does, you should give the user all
the power they need to combine your librar with others (or replace some parts of it, if they don't 
like them!)

Summary
=======

In this article, I looked at a number of functional library design principles. This is a second
article in this mini-series - the [first one](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-layers) contains
a longer introduction with a list of principles and then discusses _layers of abstraction_. In this
article, I talked about _composability_ and _avoiding callbacks_. The two are closely related, because
heavily relying on callbacks breaks composability. I also related these two terms to libraries and
frameworks, because frameworks are, by design, non-composable. 

To end on a lighter note, you can find frameworks not just in software, but also in ordinary life.
If you buy package holidays, you're buying a framework - they transport you to some place, put you
in a hotel, feed you and your activities have to fit into the shape provided by the framework (say,
go into the pool and swim there). If you travel independently, you are composing libraries. You have 
to book your flights, find your accommodation and arrange your program (all using different libraries).
It is more work, but you are in control - and you can arrange things exactly the way you need. 

With traveling, I can see why some people prefer package holidays, but in software development,
there is no excuse for building frameworks!
