<p>In the <a href="/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced the
  Microsoft Research Accelerator library. It allows us to write computations with arrays
  in C# and execute them in parallel on multi-core CPU or more interestingly, 
  using GPU shaders. In the previous article, we've seen how Accelerator works and 
  how it can be accessed from F#. In this article, we'll look at one more interesting
  F# demo - we'll implement the famous Conway's Game of Life [<a href="#accelfsh2links">1</a>] using Accelerator.
  We'll use a v2 version of Accelerator which has been announced just recently and
  is available from Microsoft Connect [<a href="#accelfsh2links">2</a>].</p>
<p>This article is the second one from a series about using Accelerator from F#. 
  Today, we'll use Accelerator types directly from F# - this is the simplest possible 
  approach and is very similar to the way you'd work with Accelerator in C#. However, 
  we can use some nice F# features such as custom operators to make the code more 
  readable. In the next article, we'll discuss a different approach - we'll look how
  to execute more "standard" F# code (that doesn't reference Accelerator explicitly)
  with Accelerator using F# quotations. The list of articles may change, but here is 
  a list of articles that I'm currently planning to write:</p>

<h2>Implementing the Game of Life</h2>
<img src="/articles/accelerator-life-game/schema.png" style="float:right; margin:10px" alt="Game of Life Schema" />
<p>The Game of Life is a zero-player game, which means that once we start it with
  some initial configuration, it will run without any other input. It runs on a square
  grid and looks like a cell or simple organism simulation. In each step, some of the
  organisms die and some new organisms appear, so we'll just need to calculate a new
  state of the grid. The game is truly amazing, because it has extremely simple set of rules, 
  but can create fantastic and very complicated structures. In fact, it is 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" type="external">Turing-complete</a>, which (roughly) means that you could 
  encode arbitrary computer program with its inputs as an initial configuration of the
  Game of Life and it would simulate the program. It would require some additional 
  coding of inputs and outputs as well as an extremely large grid, but it is theoretically
  possible!</p>
<p>You can see the rules of the game visualized in the diagram above:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Green</strong> - When an existing cell (green in the middle) has 
    three or two neighbours it survives to the next round</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong> - When an existing cell has less than two neighbours it dies, 
    because it is lonely (first red case), when it has more than three neighbors
    it dies of overcrowding (second red case)</li>    
  <li><strong>Blue</strong> - Finally, a new cell is born in an empty grid location
    if there are exactly three neighbors.</li>    
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are only three simple rules that drive the Game.
  Our implementation will simply need to calculate a new state of the grid
  based on the original one and for each element of the array, we'll check the
  three rules. However, before looking at the implementation, we'll write a couple
  of constants to configure the game and a few helpers.</p>

<h3>Getting ready</h3>
<p>Our implementation allows us to specify the size of the grid (it has to be a square)
  and a size of the window. The visualization looks the best when the size of the 
  window is a multiple of the grid size. Once we know the size, we'll initialize
  a couple of <code>FloatParallelArray</code> instances representing arrays
  of the specified size that contain constant values. We're using the <code>FPA</code>
  type alias from the <a href="/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>.</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Configuration of the game
let gridSize, formSize = 512, 512

// Initialization of constant 2D arrays
let shape = [| gridSize; gridSize; |]
let [zero; one; two; three] =
  [ for f in [0.0f; 1.0f; 2.0f; 3.0f] -&gt; new FPA(f, shape) ]
</pre>
<p>The code uses a simple sequence expression that iterates over a list of 
  constants stored as floats and yields a new <code>FPA</code> instance with
  the required size. Note that we're using a compact syntax of sequence
  expressions, because we only need to perform a projection. The result
  of the sequence expression is a list and we use pattern matching to 
  decompose the list into individual elements. The compiler cannot verify
  at compile-time that the number of elements will match, so it will issue
  a warning. However, we know that the code is correct in this case, so we don't
  need to worry. You can also turn the warning off by adding <code>#nowarn "25"</code>
  to the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>Now that we know the size of the grid and have all the needed constant arrays,
  we'll also implement a single function that wrap the Accelerator 
  functionality and three custom operators:</p>
  
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Calculating with 2D float arrays 
let rotate (a:FPA) (dx:int) dy = PA.Rotate(a, [| dx; dy |]);

// Custom operators - simulating logical operations using floats
let (&amp;&amp;.) (a:FPA) (b:FPA) = PA.Min(a, b)
let (||.) (a:FPA) (b:FPA) = PA.Max(a, b)
let (==.) (a:FPA) (b:FPA) = PA.Cond(PA.CompareEqual(a, b), one, zero)
</pre>

<p>As you can see, all of our functions and operators are simple wrappers for
  static methods of the <code>ParallelArrays</code> class (type alias <code>PA</code>).
  This makes the F# code more idiomatic and also allows us to use operators
  with the infix notation. The names of the operators ends with an additional
  dot to denote that they implement point-wise operations.</p>
<p>The <code>rotate</code> function moves elements of the array by the specified 
  offset (it is a bit similar to <code>Shift</code> that we discussed in the 
  <a href="/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">previous article</a>). However, when elements
  is shifted outside of the grid, values are copied back from 
  the other side. To demonstrate this, if we moved the contents of 1D array 
  <code>[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]</code> by +2, we'd get <code>[4; 5; 1; 2; 3]</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we define three operators that simulate Boolean operations 
  using floats. Accelerator also provides <code>BoolParallelArray</code> type,
  which can be used for calculating with arrays of Booleans, but we'll need
  to combine calculations with floats and Booleans in more sophisticated ways,
  so simulating logical operations with floating point numbers works better.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>&amp;&amp;.</code>operator simulates <em>and</em> by returning the minimum of 
    the two values. This means, that the result will be 1 only if both of the
    inputs contain 1. If any of the inputs contains 0, the overall result will be 0.</li>
  <li>The <code>||.</code> operator simulates logical <em>or</em> using maximum. 
    This means that the result will be 1 if any of the inputs contains 1.</li>    
  <li>Finally, the <code>==.</code> operator implements an equality check using
    <code>CompareWith</code> and <code>Cond</code>. When the values are equal, it
    returns a value from <code>one</code> and otherwise it returns a value from 
    <code>zero</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can manipulate with the game grid using <code>rotate</code> and also 
  simulate logical operations using floating point values 1.0 and 0.0. Let's 
  finally look how we could implement a single step of the Game of Life.</p>

<h3>Calculating the game step</h3>
<p>The state of the game will be represented as a 2D array <code>float32[,]</code>.
  We'll need some interesting initial state for the game, so we'll set all values
  to zero with the exception of a diagonal from left-upper location (when <code>x = y</code>)
  and the first row and column of the grid (<code>x = 0 || y = 0</code>). This is
  enough to start a very interesting simulation. If you'll later want to experiment
  with the code, you may try changing the initial configuration:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Create an initial data grid
let initial = Array2D.init gridSize gridSize (fun x y -&gt; 
  if x = 0 || y = 0 || x = y then 1.0f else 0.0f)
</pre>
<p>The code uses F# library function <code>Array2D.init</code>, which takes the
  dimensions of an array as first two arguments. The last argument is a function
  that calculates a value of the array at the specified coordinate. Otherwise, the
  listing doesn't show anything interesting. The function that calculates the 
  next state of the grid is much more interesting. We'll start by writing a function
  that takes <code>FPA</code> as an input and returns <code>FPA</code> as the 
  result. As I explained earlier, this is just a representation of a computation
  that can be executed later. We'll run the constructed computation later to get a 
  result of type <code>float32[,]</code>, which can be easily visualized.</p>  
<pre lang="fsharp">
let nextGeneration (grid:FPA) =
  // Generate grids shifted by 1 in every direction
  let hd::tl = 
    [ for dx in -1 .. 1 do
        for dy in -1 .. 1 do
          if dx &lt;&gt; 0 || dy &lt;&gt; 0 then 
            yield rotate grid dx dy ]

  // Count neighbors of each grid element
  let sum = tl |&gt; List.fold (+) hd
  
  // Implements the Game of Life logic
  (sum ==. three) ||. ((sum ==. two) &amp;&amp;. grid)
</pre>
<p>In the first step, the function creates a list of 8 grids rotated in all 
  of the 8 possible directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, etc). 
  This is implemented as a sequence expression that generates a single rotated
  grid for each combination of offsets (<code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>).
  It only skips the combination when both <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>
  are zero (which would correspond to the original <code>grid</code>). Note 
  that we decompose the created list into a head (first element) and a tail 
  (list of all remaining elements), because this will make further processing
  easier.</p>
<p>Now we have 8 grids, which represent the original grid shifted in each 
  direction. If we put all these layers over each other and count the number
  of living cells in each location, we'll get the number of neighbors for
  each location. This is exactly what the next line does. We're using the
  <code>List.fold</code> function with the first grid (<code>hd</code>) as an initial value and
  the overloaded point-wise addition of arrays (<code>+</code> for the <code>FPA</code> 
  type) as the aggregation function. By running the aggregation with the remaining 
  7 grids (<code>tl</code>) as the source specified using pipelining, we'll get 
  the count of neighbors.</p>
<p>Finally, the last line implements the Game of Life logic using our custom
  logical operators. We use a slightly different (but equivalent) encoding of the 
  original three rules - a specific location in the newly constructed grid
  will contain a living cell if and only if it originally had three living cells
  as neighbors (in this case we don't care whether there was originally a living
  cell in this location) or if there was a living cell originally and had two 
  neighbors.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, the last line of our code makes the F# implementation
  of the Game of Life using Accelerator really neat. A single succinct line 
  of code implements all the game logic. Now we only need to add some code to 
  visualize the Game, so that we can see the complex behavior patterns it 
  creates...</p>
  
<h2>Visualizing the game</h2>
<p>To actually run the computation and display the results, we'll need to specify
  the <em>target</em>, which is an Accelerator engine, which we can use to evaluate 
  <code>FPA</code> computations. We'll implement the game as a function that
  takes the target as an arguments, implements two local functions and then
  instantiates the <code>DrawingForm</code> type. This is a form that keeps
  running the step operation in a loop and we'll look at its source in 
  the next subsection.</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
let life(target:Target) =
  // Functions to calculate next state and to draw it
  let nextState (g:float32[,]) =
    target.ToArray2D(nextGeneration(new FPA(g)))
  let display (data:float32[,]) =
    data |&gt; toBitmap (fun f -&gt; 
      if (f &lt; 0.5f) then Color.White else Color.DarkCyan)

  // Run the drawing form with life game
  let gameForm = 
    new DrawingForm&lt;_&gt;
      (initial, nextState, display, 
       ClientSize = Size(formSize, formSize))
  Application.Run(gameForm)  

do
  life(new DX9Target())
</pre>
<p>We already have the <code>nextGeneration</code> function, which has a type
  <code>FPA -&gt; FPA</code>. It returns a computation that represents the next 
  step of the game. As we said earlier, we'll keep the current state as a type
  <code>float32[,]</code> that contains actual grid values instead of some
  abstract computation. The function <code>nextState</code> calculates the
  new state using the final representation. It takes an array as an argument,
  wraps it into <code>FPA</code> type, then calculates the next generation and
  evaluates the result using the specified target. The type of this function
  is <code>float32[,] -&gt; float32[,]</code>.</p>
<p>The second local function is <code>display</code>. It is used to visualize 
  the current state in a bitmap. This function has a type <code>float32[,] -&gt; Bitmap</code>.
  We implement it using a higher-order function <code>toBitmap</code> which takes 
  a 2D array as an argument and a function that turns a value from the array
  (in our case <code>float32</code>) into a pixel color. We provide a simple function
  that returns white color for values 0.0 and dark cyan for values 1.0. The <code>toBitmap</code>
  function isn't a part of standard F# libraries - it is implemented using direct
  memory access, which is unsafe, but efficient. You can find the implementation
  in the source code at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The last part of the function initializes the <code>DrawingForm</code> type.
  This is a reusable type that we'll implement shortly. It can be used for running
  any simulations where we want to calculate new state as fast as possible
  and redraw the form after every recalculation. We give it three parameters - 
  an initial state, a function to calculate new state and a function that draws
  the current state into a bitmap. Note that the state is a generic type parameter.
  We don't need to know what the state is as long as we're able to create a bitmap 
  from it. The last step we need to do is to implement the <code>DrawingForm</code> type...</p>

<h3>Implementing a drawing form </h3>
<p>The <code>DrawingForm</code> type is a generic class with a single type parameter
  and three constructor parameters. The type parameter represents a state, which is 
  recomputed using the provided function when the form is running. We'll implement 
  the form using the implicit class syntax:</p>
  
<pre lang="fsharp">
type DrawingForm&lt;'TState&gt;(initial, update, draw) as x = 
  inherit Form()
  // Loop that runs computation &amp; redraws form
  let rec drawingLoop(state) = 
    if not x.IsDisposed then
      ( use gr = x.CreateGraphics()
        gr.InterpolationMode &lt;- Drawing2D.InterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor
        gr.DrawImage(draw(state), x.ClientRectangle) )
      drawingLoop(update(state))

  do
    // Run the computation
    Async.Start(async { drawingLoop(initial) })
</pre>
<p>The form doesn't contain any members, so the entire body is essentially just a 
  constructor. The constructor parameters (an initial state and two functions) are
  written directly following the type name. It starts by inheriting from the .NET
  <code>Form</code> type. Next, it declares a single local recursive function 
  <code>drawingLoop</code> the function runs until the form is closed. It keeps the 
  current state as a parameter (which is a typical functional technique). </p>
<p>After making sure that the form is still displayed, it redraws the graphics 
  using the current state. Note that we use the <code>use</code> keyword to dispose
  the <code>gr</code> object when it is no longer in scope. In this case, we
  need to specify the scope explicitly using parentheses.
  Inside the drawing code, we need to obtain a bitmap to draw on the form. We
  do it by calling the <code>draw</code> function (a constructor parameter) with 
  the current state as an argument. Once we're done with drawing, we calculate
  new state by calling the <code>update</code> function and continue looping
  by recursively invoking <code>drawingLoop</code>.</p>  
<p>Finally, the <code>do</code> block contains code that's executed when the object is created.
  The only thing we do is that we start the function performing the drawing on
  a background thread. Note that this is safe, because <code>CreateGraphics</code> 
  method is one of the few members of the <code>Form</code> type that can be 
  accessed from non-GUI threads. We use a single asynchronous workflow to 
  start the computation. This is simply a convenient way to start a background
  task, because <code>Async.Start</code> starts executing the workflow in 
  background.</p>
  
<h2>Extending the example</h2>
<p>And that's it! There are various ways to make the application more interesting.
  One option is to enable some user interaction. The source code below adds a simple
  handler for mouse click. When you click on the form using left button, it will add 
  some randomly located living cells and right button removes some of them. This allows
  you to create some nice patterns:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>


<h2>Summary</h2>  
<p>In this article, we've seen an interesting demo of using the Accelerator library 
  from F#. We've used many of the standard methods for working with <code>FloatParallelArray</code>
  type, which is the core of Accelerator. Among others, we've used <code>Rotate</code> for calculating
  neighbors and <code>Min</code>, <code>Max</code> together with <code>Cond</code> to implement
  logical operators for working with arrays. Then we encoded the logic of the Game of Life using
  a simple data-parallel expression that allows the Accelerator to run the code efficiently in parallel
  either using GPU or using multi-core CPU.</p>
<p>There are still many interesting things to explore. We've already seen two examples of using
  Accelerator from F# in the direct way, so we won't look at more complicated demos. Instead, we'll
  look at more sophisticated way of using Accelerator. In the next part, we'll use F# quotations
  (which are similar to C# expression trees) to write the data processing code as a standard F# code
  (this for example enables easier debugging) and then execute it using Accelerator.</p>
