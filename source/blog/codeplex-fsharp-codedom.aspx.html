<p>You probably already saw my post regarding CodeDOM generator for the F# language and how to use it with ASP.NET. To make it more accessible for everyone, I created project at the new Microsoft community site called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com">CodePlex</a> [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com" target="_blank">^</a>].</p>
<ul>
<li>To learn more about the project, visit <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom">Project Home Page</a></li> 
<li>If you want to send some comments, go to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Project/ListForums.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom">Discussion Board</a></li> 
<li>You can also download latest source code - <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom">Latest Check-Ins</a></li> 
<li>And finally, the latest releases can be found at the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=fscodedom">Releases Page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
BTW: CodePlex looks like a really good site. It is based on Visual Studio Team System (which means that developers of the project can do most of the work directly from Visual Studio). It provides management of "Work Items" (TODO list), source control and many other useful things! For example if you have any feature requests or bug requests, send them to the discussion and I can easily create work item from the message in the discussions.

If you are interested in this project and you want to help with developing of some parts, or if you are working on a project that is related to CodeDOM and F#, please let me know. Any help or feedback is kindly welcome!
