<p>A couple of months ago, I posted a list of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx">
  F# talks and courses for Autumn 2011</a>. Although I tried hard to have <em>fewer</em>
  speaking engagements during the winter and spring, there are quite a few events that
  I'd like to invite you to.
</p>

<p>Last year, I spent quite a lot of time talking about asynchronous programming
  and agents. I think this is still a very important topic and especially agent-based programming
  in F# is a powerful way to implement concurrency primitives (like blocking queue), as well as 
  complex systems (like <a href="http://www.trayport.com/en/joule/video">trading screens</a>
  and <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/functional-londoners-may-meetup">market analysis</a>).
  I also wrote a series of articles on this topic that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273081.aspx">are
  available on MSDN</a> and should be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I'll be doing some talks about type providers, which is an upcoming F# 3.0
  technology for accessing data. However, I also hope to find some time to look at other directions for F#,
  especially how it can be used in an online web-based environment, either using Azure or by translating F# to JavaScript 
  using a recently announced <a href="http://pitfw.posterous.com/">open-source project named Pit</a>.</p>

<h2>Functional .NET and F# Courses</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-talks-courses-2012a/sm.gif" class="rdecor" />
<p>In October and December, we had the first run of two courses that I'm doing together with  
  <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a> at SkillsMatter in London.
  We had some <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Imaji/status/130045638653128704">nice feedback</a>
  and we also plan a couple of improvements, so the next runs should be even better. 
  We are doing two courses - the first one introduces F# and functional programming and
  the second one covers some more advanced F# topics. For more information and a detailed content, 
  see <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">F# trainings for .NET developers</a>.</p>
  
<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Functional Programming in .NET</strong> (in London on <strong>30 January</strong> and <strong>16 April</strong>)<br />
    The course is designed for developers with some C# background who want to become better programmers and learn F# on the side.
    For booking, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/functional-programming-in-dot-net/dh-2239">visit SkillsMatter web site</a>
    or <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net?subject=F%23 Courses">contact us directly</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Real-World F# Programming</strong> (in London on <strong>8 February</strong> and <strong>11 June</strong>)<br />
    The course is designed for people with some existing F# experience. It focuses on the most applications of 
    F#, including data processing, asynchronous and concurrent programming.

</ul>

<h2>Coming to New York!</h2>
<p>I'm also very pleased to announce that we'll be doing the <strong>Functional Programming in .NET</strong>
  course in New York on <strong>23 April</strong>. This is quite far from now, so you'll definitely read
  about it again on my blog. If you're interested in attending the course
  in NY in April, you can also book at the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/functional-programming-in-dot-net-nyc/dh-2239">SkillsMatter web site</a>
  or <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net?subject=F%23 Courses">get in touch</a> (we can also offer a private
  training for your company).</p>

<p>While visiting USA, I'll also definitely speak at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-fsharp/">New 
  York F# User Group</a>. The exact date and topic will appear at the group page when the time comes, but
  I'm really looking forward to meeting the F# NY community. </p>

<h2>London talks and tutorials</h2>
<p>Aside from the courses, I'll be also doing one talk on type providers at 
  <strong>Functional Programming eXchange</strong> on type providers and a short tutorial 
  (together with Phil Trelford) at <strong>QCon London</strong>. Aside, if you're interested in 
  functional programming and software architecture, you can also check out Phil Trelford's 
  talk at the <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2012/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=542">Software architecture track</a>
  at <strong>GOTO Copenhagen</strong>.</p>

<h3>QCon London</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">The QCon conference doesn't need an introduction.
  Together with Phil Trelford, we're doing a tutorial called 
  <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=3891">Turning to the Functional Side with F#</a>.
  The tutorial focuses on the functional approach to thinking about programming problems
  and especially at domain modelling using F#. No prior F# knowledge is needed, but
  we'll have some more advanced materials for those who already played with F# a bit.</p>

<h3>Functional Programming eXchange</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is a one-day conference on functional programming 
  that includes talks on a mix of functional programming techniques and languages 
  including F#, Scala and Haskell.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I'll be doing an in depth talk on F# type providers, covering
  some of the standard providers, but also an implementation of custom providers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to attend, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/functional-programming-exchange-2012">book online now</a>!</li>
  <li>The conference takes place on <strong>16 March</strong>.</li>
