    }<h1>F# Webcast (II.) - Using .NET libraries</h1>
<p>About a week ago I posted <a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the first part</a> of my F# webcast series.
  It focused on explaining the basic ideas behind functional programming such as immutability, recursion
  and passing functions as arguments to other functions (or methods in C#). In the first part, we've seen some
  C# code to demonstrate the ideas and also a bit of F#, mainly to show the basic language features.
</p>

<p>The second part is going to be exclusively about F#. It'll demonstrate how we can start writing
  a demo application that grabs data from RSS feeds and processes them. You'll learn how to access
  .NET libraries from F# (in particular, we'll use <code>System.Net</code> and <code>System.Xml</code>).
  We'll develop the code iteratively, which means that we'll start by simply enumerating the RSS elements using <code>for</code> loop and printing the results and then we'll refactor the code to use <em>tuples</em> and <em>sequence expressions</em> to turn it into processing code that generates a sequence of feed items. Finally we'll also demonstrate how to use some of the functions from the previous part such as <code>List.filter</code> in practice.</p>

<h2>F# Webcast Series</h2>
<p>This webcast series follows the usual F# development process
  where you start with experimenting and writing an initial version of the solution interactively using the 
  F# interactive tool. In the later phase of the process, we modify the code to make it parallel and asynchronous
  and finally, we can also encapsulate it into a standard .NET library that's usable from C#. 
  Here is a list of all webcasts in the series:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">Part I. - Introducing functional concepts</a></strong><br />
    The first part introduces functional programming principles such as immutability, recursion and functions
    that take other functions as parameter (<em>higher order</em> functions). This can all be demonstrated in
    C# 3.0, so we start with C# and then look how the same concepts look in F#. Finally, the first part also
    shows functions for working with lists in F#.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>Part II. - Using standard .NET libraries</strong><br />
    The second part demonstrates how we can use standard .NET libraries. It uses classes from <code>System.Net</code>
    and <code>System.Xml</code> to download content of a web page (RSS feed), load it into XML document and 
    process it to find only posts that contain some specified keyword.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">Part III. - Downloading web pages asynchronously</a></strong><br />
    The third part shows how to make the code from the part II. better. It introduces F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>
    that can be used for writing code that doesn't block a thread when waiting for the completion of some I/O request.
    This part also shows how to modify the code to download and process multiple feeds in parallel.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx">Part IV. - Developing standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    In the fourth part, we look how to encapsulate the functionality written in F# into classes. 
    We'll finally create a project (rather than just use F# scripts) and we'll wrap the code we wrote into
    a .NET class. We'll also look how to compile the project into DLL and how to use it from a simple C# web application.</li>
