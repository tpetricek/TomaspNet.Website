    }<h1>F# Webcast (IV.) - Developing standard .NET libraries</h1>
<p>In the previous parts of this webcast series we've developed an F# script that downloads RSS feeds
  asynchronously and in parallel and searches them for the specified keywords. We followed the usual F#
  development style, so after introducing <a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the basic functional 
  concepts</a>, we wrote the code in <a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the simples possible style</a> 
  and demonstrated how to use <code>System.Xml</code> and <code>System.Net</code> namespaces. Then we 
  <a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">refactored the existing code</a>, to run asynchronously and process
  the results potentially in parallel, which was very easy thanks to F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>.</p>

<p>In this part of the series, we'll make the next evolutionary step of our sample application. We'll turn
  the code that originally used F# tuples and lists into code that uses standard .NET objects and we'll
  also see how to declare a class in F#. This simple modification will turn the script into an F# library
  that is almost indistinguishable from a library developed in C#. We'll also look how you can use the library
  from C# web application to show the interop between C# and F# in practice. We'll start
  with the code from the <a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">previous part</a>, so if you missed that, you
  may want to check it out or download the source code.</p>

<h2>F# Webcast Series</h2>
<p>This webcast series follows the usual F# development process
  where you start with experimenting and writing an initial version of the solution interactively using the 
  F# interactive tool. In the later phase of the process, we modify the code to make it parallel and asynchronous
  and finally, we can also encapsulate it into a standard .NET library that's usable from C#. 
  Here is a list of all webcasts in the series:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">Part I. - Introducing functional concepts</a></strong><br />
    The first part introduces functional programming principles such as immutability, recursion and functions
    that take other functions as parameter (<em>higher order</em> functions). This can all be demonstrated in
    C# 3.0, so we start with C# and then look how the same concepts look in F#. Finally, the first part also
    shows functions for working with lists in F#.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">Part II. - Using standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    The second part demonstrates how we can use standard .NET libraries. It uses classes from <code>System.Net</code>
    and <code>System.Xml</code> to download content of a web page (RSS feed), load it into XML document and 
    process it to find only posts that contain some specified keyword.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">Part III. - Downloading web pages asynchronously</a></strong><br />
    The third part shows how to make the code from the part II. better. It introduces F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>
    that can be used for writing code that doesn't block a thread when waiting for the completion of some I/O request.
    This part also shows how to modify the code to download and process multiple feeds in parallel.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>Part IV. - Developing standard .NET libraries</strong><br />
    In the fourth part, we look how to encapsulate the functionality written in F# into classes. 
    We'll finally create a project (rather than just use F# scripts) and we'll wrap the code we wrote into
    a .NET class. We'll also look how to compile the project into DLL and how to use it from a simple C# web application.</li>
