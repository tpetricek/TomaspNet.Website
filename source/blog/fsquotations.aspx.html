    }<h1>F# - Simple quotations transformation</h1>

<p>This article describes very simple code that I wrote while learning
  how to work with the F# quotations library. Using the F# quotations you 
  can get tree representation of the quoted expression. This allows you
  to write code that takes code written in F# as data and performs some
  code analysis or compiles/translates that code to different language.
  This is very similar to the new C# 3.0 expression trees where you can 
  get expression tree from lambda expression and translate this tree 
  for example to SQL (using DLINQ). However expression trees in C# 3.0 
  are very limited when compared with F# quotations, so that's one of 
  the many reasons why F# is interesting language.</p>

<h2>Introduction to F# quotations</h2>
<p>If you want to see how F# represents some expressions you can try
  it in the FSI (F# interactive). First you need to 
  open three modules that contain functions for working with quotations:</p>
<pre>
open Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations;;
open Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Raw;;
open Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Typed;;
</pre>
<p>Now you can see the internal representation of quotations by writing 
  quoted expression (In VS.Net you can select code and hit Alt+Enter to 
  sent selected code to F# interactive).</p>
<pre>
<span class="a">&lt;@@ 1 + 2 @@&gt;</span>

val it : int expr
  = &lt;@@ 
      Microsoft.FSharp.MLLib.Pervasives.op_Addition (Int32 1) (Int32 2)
     @@&gt; 
</pre>
<p>One more example with two operators:</p>
<pre>
<span class="a">&lt;@@ 1 + 10/5 @@&gt;</span>

val it : int expr
  = &lt;@@ 
      Microsoft.FSharp.MLLib.Pervasives.op_Addition (Int32 1)
        (Microsoft.FSharp.MLLib.Pervasives.op_Division (Int32 10) (Int32 5))
     @@&gt;
</pre>
<p>It is not difficult to understand that addition in the first example is represented 
  as function call (function application in the terminology of functional languages) 
  where the function is <code>op_Addition</code> operator and parameters are
  two integers. This is actually little simplification, because in functional
  programming you should look at this code as two function applications.
  The first application binds first parameter of <code>op_Addition</code> to
  <code>1</code> and the result is again function. The second application uses
  the function returned by the first application and passes <code>2</code> as
  parameter. You can look at F# quotations using both approaches and in the 
  rest of the article I will use the first one.</p>
  
<p>To demonstrate how to work with F# quotations I decided to write simple
  transformation of limited mathematical expressions from F# quotations to my
  data type. The discriminated union that I'm using as target of transformation
  is similar to the union in F# source file VS.Net template (as you can see
  it supports only four most basic mathematical operations and all values
  are stored as integers):</p>
<pre>
type simple_expr =
  | Int of int
  | Add of simple_expr * simple_expr
  | Sub of simple_expr * simple_expr
  | Mul of simple_expr * simple_expr
  | Div of simple_expr * simple_expr;;
</pre>
<p>Printing and evaluation of this structure is simple, so I won't describe these
  here. If you want to look at these functions see attached source code.
  (function for evaluation is part of VS.Net template too).</p> 

<h2>Working with quotations</h2>
<p>Finally, let's do the interesting part :-). As I mentioned you can get 
  quotations using <code>&lt;@@ ... @@&gt;</code>. When you want to perform 
  analysis of quotations, you need to get the underlying raw representation
  using the <code>&lt;@@@@ ... @@@@&gt;</code> operators. For decomposing the
  quoted expression we can use <code>Query</code> functions on the expression 
  families defined in the <code>Raw</code> module. This may sound a bit confusing,
  but in the simple words - the <code>Raw</code> module contains several
  values that define language constructs (like constants, variables, function
  application and others) and you can use these values for matching and decomposing
  quoted expression. Following code should clear this a bit:</p> 
<pre>
let what_is x =
  match Raw.efInt32.Query x with  
    | Some (_) -&gt; "number";
    | _ -&gt; 
  match Raw.efApps.Query x with  
    | Some (_) -&gt; "application";
    | _ -&gt; 
      "something else...";
	    
<span class="c">// Prints "number"</span>	    
print_string (what_is &lt;@@@@ 1 @@@@&gt;);

<span class="c">// Prints "application"</span>	    
print_string (what_is &lt;@@@@ 1 + 2 @@@@&gt;);
</pre>

<p>Now we can start writing function that converts mathematical expression
  quotation to <code>simple_expr</code> structure. It will be recursive function 
  with similar structure as previous. The first match for conversion of numbers  
  will be simple. In the second match we'll have to do two things. First we'll
  need to determine what function is applied (whether it is addition, subtraction,
  etc..) and than we'll have to loop through parameters passed to this function
  and call the function recursively each parameter.</p>
<pre>
let rec parse x =
  match Raw.efInt32.Query x with  
    <span class="c">// x contains the number so we can simply return Int(x)</span>
    | Some (x) -&gt; Int(x); 
    | _ -&gt; 
  match Raw.efApps.Query x with  
    | Some (op,args) -&gt; 
    
      <span class="c">// op contains quoted reference to function (operator)
      // so we need to extract name of applied function from it</span>
      let opname = (
        match Raw.efAnyTopDefn.Query op with  
          <span class="c">// operators are top-level definitions so we extract name
          // from 'a' that contains info about the definition</span>
          | Some (a,_) -&gt; let t1,t2 = a.topDefPath in t2
          | _ -&gt; failwith ("Function is not a top level definition.");
        ) in
      
      <span class="c">// Recursively translate arguments to simple_expr 
      // and convert returned list to array</span>
      let av = List.to_array(List.map (fun arg -&gt; parse arg) args) in
      
      <span class="c">// Finally, match the operation name with basic 
      // operator names and return according simple_expr value</span>
      (match opname with
        | "op_Addition"    -&gt; Add(av.(0),av.(1))
        | "op_Subtraction" -&gt; Sub(av.(0),av.(1))
        | "op_Multiply"    -&gt; Mul(av.(0),av.(1))
        | "op_Division"    -&gt; Div(av.(0),av.(1))
        | _ -&gt;
          <span class="c">// some other operation - error</span>
          failwith "Not supported operation");
    | _ -&gt;
      <span class="c">// something else than efApps and efInt32 - error</span>
      failwith "Not supported construction in expression.";;
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned, the more interesting part of the code is when the quotation 
  matches with <code>efApps</code> which in our case means that the expression is 
  mathematical operation. From the functional point of view <code>efApps</code> means
  series of function applications. The result of <code>Query</code>
  function of <code>efApps</code> is tuple containing expression with 
  information about applied function (operator in our case) and parameters of 
  this application.</p>
<p>For extracting operator name we match the first value with <code>efAnyTopDef</code>
  which returns information about top-level definitions. Returned structure contains
  assembly name as well as the function name that we need. In the second step
  we recursively call <code>parse</code> function to all arguments of operator.
  Once we know the function name and we have arguments translated to <code>simple_expr</code>,
  we can return the according <code>simple_expr</code> value.</p>
