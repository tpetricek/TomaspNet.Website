    }<h1>Imperative computation in F# (I.) - Returning results from a function</h1>
<p>One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like <code>return false</code> in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of <em>currently executing statement</em>
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  <em>current statement</em>, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional 
  Programming</a>, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.</p>

<p>Often, there is really no need to use <code>break</code> or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as <code>Seq.exists</code> or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to <code>Seq.exists</code>) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.</p>  

<p>So, what can be done about this? Adding imperative language features to F# seems
  a bit weird (at least to me), because it breaks the nice notion that everything
  is an expression, which makes it easy to reason about what the code does (again, 
  there is an example of this in chapter 2 of my book). On the other hand, having these
  features would be really nice sometimes. In this article series, we'll look how to 
  implement computation expression that allows us to write imperative code in F#.
  Computation expressions (an introduction is in chapter 12) allow us to create blocks
  of F# code that add some non-standard meaning to the usual F# code. In this first 
  article, we'll allow returning from anywhere inside the body using 
  <code>return <em>&lt;expr&gt;</em></code>. In the next articles of the series, we'll
  look at more imperative constructs such as <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>
  and we'll look even further and explore some features that aren't available in 
  C#, but can be useful sometimes.</p>  

<h2>Programming with expressions</h2>  
<p>When programming in F#, everything is an expression. The easy way to understand
  what this means for a C# programmer is to imagine that we'd have to use conditional
  expressions (<code>&lt;expr&gt;?&lt;expr&gt;:&lt;expr&gt;</code>) instead of the usual
  <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code> construct. Other constructs such
  as <code>for</code> loop would be also slightly different, but we don't need to go 
  into the details. Now, C# allows you to use <code>return</code> as a <em>statement</em>
  anywhere, but you cannot use it as an <em>expression</em>, which means that the 
  following isn't valid C# code:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
return 
  (input == 1)
    ? (20 + 22) 
    : (4 * (return false));
</pre>  
<p>The purpose of this example was just to demonstrate that disallowing imperative 
  <code>return</code> in F# makes quite a good sense. The next point that I want to make
  before looking how to get imperative programming style in F# is that in many
  situations you don't really need to write the code in the imperative way.
  For example, let's say that you want to return <code>true</code> when some input
  collection of integers contains a number larger than 10 and <code>false</code> otherwise.
  The usual way to write this in C# would be something like this:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
foreach(var n in input) 
  if (n &gt; 10) return true;
return false;
</pre>
<p>There are various ways to write the same thing in F# - if you wanted to write this
  for the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> type directly in F#, you couldn't use 
  built-in <code>for</code> loop (because there is no way to return from it). This means
  that you'd have to call <code>GetEnumerator</code> explicitly and write a recursive
  function to do the processing. That sounds like a lot of pain. However, the F#
  library contains many generally useful higher order functions that make problems
  like this trivial. The previous example can be implemented in F# like this: </p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
Seq.exists (fun n -&gt; n &gt; 10) input
</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is even easier than the original imperative solution. 
  In fact, when using C# 3.0 and LINQ you would probably use one of the extension
  methods together with C# lambda expressions to write the code in a functional
  way even in C#. This means that before you'll think about using imperative style
  in F#, you should always check whether the same thing cannot be done in a lot
  simpler way using functions like <code>Seq.fold</code>, <code>Seq.exists</code>
  or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. That said, we can now look how to simulate
  imperative programming in F# when we're really sure that we want it.</p>

<h2>Imperative computations</h2>
<p>When implementing F# computation expression, we need to create a <em>builder</em>
  object that contains a few primitive members that are used to compose the code
  from parts of the computations written by the user. We'll look at the implementation
  of the builder in a second. Once we'll have it - we'll call it <code>ImperativeBuilder</code>,
  we can write the following code to create <code>imperative</code> value that's used when
  writing all the imperative computations.</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let imperative = new ImperativeBuilder()  
</pre>
<p>This one line of code created the builder, which we can now use to write imperative
  style of code in F#. We'll start by looking at some trivial example to demonstrate
  how the code works under the cover. Then we'll look at the implementation of the
  <code>ImperativeBuilder</code> and finally we'll write some more real world example.
  The following listing shows a single imperative function that contains the <code>return</code>
  statement two times. The behavior should be the same as C# - we want the first value
  to be returned and we don't want the <code>printfn</code> function to be ever called.</p>    
<pre lang="fsharp">
let test() = imperative {
  return 0
  printfn "after return!"
  return 1 }
</pre>
<p>When the F# compiler sees this code, it translates it into a couple of calls to 
  primitives provided by the <code>imperative</code> builder. The most important primitives
  for us now are <code>Return</code>, which is used when translating the <code>return</code>
  keyword and <code>Combine</code>. The <code>return</code> keyword denotes the end of a
  sub-expression, so when we use it multiple times, the compiler needs some way to combine
  these sub-expressions into one and that's exactly when it uses the <code>Combine</code>
  primitive.</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
imperative.Run
 (imperative.Combine
   (imperative.Return(0),
    imperative.Delay(fun () ->
      printfn "after return"
      imperative.Return(1))))
</pre>
<p>There are a few other primitives that you can see in this example. We'll talk about them
  shortly when discussing the implementation. However, the important point that the original
  code that contained multiple <code>return</code> constructs (and felt like a sequence of
  statements) has been translated into a standard F# expression.</p>      

<h3>Designing the computation type</h3>  
<p>The key question when implementing computations like this one is what the type 
  of the expression we've seen above is? We'll represent the computation using a type called
  <code>Imperative&lt;'T&gt;</code> and most of the primitives above work with this type.
  In particular, the <code>Return</code> primitive takes a value of some type - in our 
  example above <code>int</code> and returns a value of type <code>Imperative&lt;int&gt;</code>.
  The <code>Combine</code> primitive takes two values of type <code>Imperative&lt;int&gt;</code> 
  as an argument and returns a combined value of the same type.</p>

<p>Now, what should this type look like, so that we can implement the desired imperative
  behavior using the computation builder primitives? First of all, it must be a lazy type, 
  which means that the <code>printfn</code> function shouldn't be called when evaluating
  the arguments for the <code>Combine</code> member. The easiest way to achieve this is
  to write the type as a function that takes a <code>unit</code> as an argument and returns
  something. This means that we don't have to run the second part of the code in the 
  <code>Combine</code> primitive, when the first part already returned some value.</p>  

<p>The second question is - what should be the value returned by this function? We must be
  able to represent computations that don't return any value (for example, when we have 
  <code>if</code>-<code>then</code> loop without the <code>else</code> clause and the condition
  evaluates to <code>false</code>) and we need to represent computations that 
  return something using the <code>return</code> primitive. The usual way to 
  represent a value that may be missing in F# is to use the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code>
  type, so we'll end up with a type that looks like this:</p>  

<pre lang="fsharp">
type Imperative&lt;'T&gt; = unit -&gt; option&lt;'T&gt;
</pre>

<p>This type can easily represent the two parts of the computation we've seen above.
  The first one (containing only <code>return</code>) will be represented as a function
  that immediately returns a value <code>Some(0)</code> and the second one will be
  represented as a function that prints string using the <code>printfn</code> function
  and then returns a value <code>Some(1)</code>.
  A more complicated computation such as the <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>
  conditional without the <code>else</code> clause would be represented as a function
  that evaluates the condition; if the condition is <code>true</code> it runs the computation in the
  <code>then</code> clause and returns its result and otherwise returns <code>None</code>.</p>

<h3>Implementing the computation</h3>  
<p>Now that we have the type that can represent the computations let's have a look
  at the implementation of the computation builder. We'll start by implementing the
  core primitives that were used in the example above. In the last section 
  of the article, we'll also add support for two looping constructs that can be 
  used inside computation expressions (<code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops).</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
type ImperativeBuilder() = 
  // Create computation that returns the given value  
  member x.Return(v) : Imperative&lt;_&gt; = 
    (fun () -&gt; Some(v))
  // Create computation that doesn't return any value
  member x.Zero() = (fun () -&gt; None)

  // Return a computation that will evaluate the provided function  
  // only when the computation is being evaluated
  member x.Delay(f:unit -&gt; Imperative&lt;_&gt;) = 
    (fun () -&gt; f()())
  
  // Combines two delayed computations (that may return 
  // value imperatively using 'return') into one  
  member x.Combine(a, b) = (fun () -&gt;
    // run the first part of the computation
    match a() with 
    // if it returned, we can return the result immediately
    | Some(v) -&gt; Some(v) 
    // otherwise, we need to run the second part
    | _ -&gt; b() )
  
  // Execute the imperative computation 
  // expression given as an argument
  member x.Run(imp) = 
    // run the computation and return the result or 
    // fail when the computation didn't return anything
    match imp() with 
    | Some(v) -&gt; v 
    | None -&gt; failwith "nothing returned!"
</pre>
<p>The first two members give us a way to construct primitive computations. The 
  computation created using <code>Return</code> is used when you write <code>return</code>
  and represents a computation that returns something when executed. The second one
  represents a computation that doesn't do anything and is used in places where
  the F# compiler needs to fill in some blank space (for example when we don't
  provide the <code>else</code> clause). The <code>Delay</code> is also interesting.
  As we've seen when looking at the translation, it is used to wrap the second 
  part of the computation when using <code>Combine</code> to make sure that the
  code which can do some side-effects (such as printing to the console) will be 
  executed only when the second part of the computation is actually needed.</p>

<p>The first three primitives are used for creating individual parts of the computation
  that are later composed together into a single computation that represents the 
  whole imperative block of code. This composition is done using the <code>Combine</code>
  primitive, which will get two computations as an argument. It returns a function
  (delayed computation) that, when executed, tries to run the first computation 
  and returns its result if it returns a value. If the first computation doesn't
  return, it simply runs the second one and returns its result.</p>  

<p>Finally, the computation builder also contains the <code>Run</code> primitive, 
  which is used to wrap the whole computation. Inside this primitive, we run the 
  computation to convert the internal representation (<code>Imperative&lt;'T&gt;</code>)
  into the actual value that we want to return (<code>'T</code>). When the
  computation returns <code>None</code>, we throw an exception because this means
  that the computation completed without ending with any <code>return</code> statement
  (we could also use <code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;'T&gt;</code> to return 
  zero or <code>null</code> if we wanted to simulate the behavior of C/C++,
  but we don't want to go that far in this article!) .</p>
  
<h2>Real world example</h2>
<p>Now that we've implemented the computation builder, we can take a look at some
  more realistic example where you may want to use imperative coding style. Most of
  the really interesting use cases will need imperative loops, so we'll get back to them
  soon, but even without loops, we can already write quite interesting code. The
  following listing shows a function that validates whether a provided string is a 
  well-formed name. It uses various heuristics such as that the name should be
  at least two words, both reasonably long and both starting with an uppercase letter
  (By the way, sorry if your name doesn't pass the test - it's just a demo!)</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; let validateName(arg:string) = imperative {
    // Should be non-empty and should contain space
    if (arg = null) then return false
    let idx = arg.IndexOf(" ")
    if (idx = -1) then return false
    
    // Verify the name and the surname
    let name = arg.Substring(0, idx)
    let surname = arg.Substring(idx + 1, arg.Length - idx - 1)
    if (surname.Length &lt; 1 || name.Length &lt; 1) then return false
    if (Char.IsLower(surname.[0]) || Char.IsLower(name.[0])) then return false

    // Looks like we've got a valid name!
    return true }
<em>val validateName : string -&gt; bool</em>

&gt; validateName(null);;
<em>val it : bool = false</em>
&gt; validateName("Tomas");;
<em>val it : bool = false</em>
&gt; validateName("Tomas Petricek");;
<em>val it : bool = true</em>
</pre>

<p>The code uses quite common imperative programming pattern. It implements
  various checks that are applied to the name and when the check fails, it 
  immediately returns <code>false</code> as the result, otherwise it continues
  to the next check. In functional languages, this can be implemented either
  using nested <code>if</code>-<code>then</code>-<code>else</code> conditions
  or using pattern matching. If we wanted to avoid nesting in the second case, 
  we'd have to move the entire check into the <code>when</code> clause, which
  would complicate the code. This means, that the code above is quite elegant
  solution for the problem and is in many ways cleaner than code you'd write
  using standard functional constructs.</p>
<p>In this example the difference between imperative and functional version
  would be mostly syntactical. I believe that <em>syntax matters</em>, so this is 
  a good argument for me, but it may not be convincing example for everyone.
  In the next section, we'll add support for using imperative <code>return</code>
  inside loops, which will simplify solving some problems in a more significant way.</p>

<h2>Supporting imperative loops</h2>
<p>If we want to allow the user to write <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops
  inside computation expressions, we need to add two additional members to our computation
  builder. In most of the cases, these members can be implemented in terms of other
  primitives (such as <code>Combine</code> and <code>Zero</code>) by using the code
  you can see below. Note that exactly the same code would work for many other computation 
  expressions, because we don't use the <code>Imperative&lt;'T&gt;</code> value directly.
  However, in the next articles of this series, we'll need to change this implementation
  a bit, so it is good that the F# language allows us to implement this ourselves.</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
type ImperativeBuilder with
  member x.For(inp:seq&lt;_&gt;, f) =
    // Process next element from the sequence
    let rec loop(en:IEnumerator&lt;_&gt;) = 
      // If there are no more elements, return empty computation
      if not(en.MoveNext()) then x.Zero() else
        // Otherwise call body and combine it with a 
        // computation that continues looping
        x.Combine(f(en.Current), x.Delay(fun () -&gt; loop(en)))
    // Start enumerating from the first element
    loop(inp.GetEnumerator())
    
  member x.While(gd, body) = 
    // Perform one step of the 'looping'
    let rec loop() =
      // If the condition is false, return empty computation
      if not(gd()) then x.Zero() else
        // Otherwise, call body and then loop again
        x.Combine(body, x.Delay(fun () -&gt; loop()))
    loop()
</pre>
<p>We use type augmentation to add the two members to the existing 
  <code>ImperativeBuilder</code> type. The implementation of both of the new primitives is 
  quite similar. In both of the cases, we create a recursive function that performs
  one step of the looping and returns computation that should be executed after the
  step is performed. This means that the loop is 'unfolded' into a series of
  computation steps that are combined using the <code>Combine</code> primitive
  that we declared above. Note that we're also using the <code>Delay</code> primitive
  to make sure that the next step of the looping is run only when it is actually needed.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, the <code>Combine</code> member may not need to run the 
  second argument when the computation given as the first argument already returns some
  value (using <code>return</code>). For our looping primitives, this means that
  whenever one step of the looping runs the <code>Return</code> primitive, we'll stop
  looping and immediately return the result. </p>

<h3>Returning from while loop</h3>  
<p>Now, let's have a look at how can we use the looping constructs to solve some 
  real world problems. We'll start with the <code>while</code> loop and we'll use it
  to create a loop that reads names from the console and returns the first one that's valid:</p>  

<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; let readFirstName() = imperative {
    // Loop until the user enters valid name
    while true do
      let name = Console.ReadLine()
      // If the name is valid, we return it, otherwise
      // we continue looping...
      if (validateName(name)) then return name
      printfn "That's not a valid name! Try again..." }
<em>val it : (unit -> string) = &lt;fun:clo@@0&gt;</em>

&gt; readFirstName();;
<em>Tomas
That's not a valid name! Try again...
Tomas Petricek
val it : string = "Tomas Petricek"</em>
</pre>
<p>The listing starts by implementing the <code>readFirstName</code> function. If we look at 
  its signature printed by the F# interactive, we can see that it returns <code>string</code>,
  which is exactly what we wanted. The function contains an infinite loop written using 
  <code>while true do</code> loop, but because we can imperatively return from loops using
  <code>return</code>, it isn't actually an infinite loop. The function starts by 
  reading a name from the console and then uses the function we created earlier to test
  whether the name is a valid name. If it is valid, then we want to return it as the result
  and if it is not, then we continue looping.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, how the F# compiler translates the <code>if</code> expression.
  In the <code>true</code> case, it uses calls something like <code>imperative.Return(name)</code>
  to create an imperative computation that returns the name. We didn't provide any code to
  use for the <code>false</code> case, so the compiler uses the "empty computation" we provided
  and generates something like <code>imperative.Zero()</code>. As we've already seen, the 
  <code>Zero</code> member returns a computation that doesn't yet have the return value. 
  This means that when we finish executing the body of the loop and get back to the <code>Combine</code> 
  primitive, it will execute the next iteration of the loop. On the other hand, if we return
  value using <code>Return</code>, the <code>Combine</code> primitive will see that we 
  already have the return value, so it will stop looping.
</p>  

<h3>Returning from for loop</h3>
<p>To finish our discussion, let's look at one more real-world example where the imperative
  <code>return</code> is useful. In the beginning of the article, I wrote that we don't
  need to use imperative constructs in many of the cases, because the F# library contains
  higher order functions that make it possible to express the same thing (often even more
  concisely). However, implementing these higher order functions (such as <code>Seq.exists</code>)
  isn't as easy as it could be. For example, the <code>exists</code> function that takes
  a sequence as an argument has to be implemented by directly using <code>GetEnumerator</code>.</p>
<p>The following example shows that implementing <code>exists</code> function taking
  a sequence and a predicate as arguments using our <code>imperative</code> computation 
  is very easy, because we can simply use <code>for</code> loop to enumerate over the source 
  sequence. When the predicate returns <code>true</code> for the first time, 
  we can immediately terminate the execution and return <code>true</code> as the overall result.</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
&gt; let exists f inp = imperative {
    for v in inp do 
      if f(v) then return true
    return false }
<em>val exists : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; seq&lt;'a&gt; -> bool</em>

&gt; [ 1 .. 10 ] |&gt; exists (fun v -&gt; v % 3 = 0)
<em>val it : bool = true</em>
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the implementation of the function couldn't be easier. If the 
  predicate returns true for any of the elements, we imperatively return <code>true</code>
  and if all the elements are enumerated without finding any element like that, 
  we come to the last line of the function, which returns <code>false</code>. It is
  important to note that in the example above, the predicate is executed only
  for elements <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, because when we
  reach <code>3</code>, we can return <code>true</code> without accessing the rest of the list.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we implemented the first version of the <code>imperative</code> computation
  builder that allows us to use imperative <code>return</code> statement that returns the result
  from any place in the function. We started with a relatively simple version and then we extended
  it to also support two standard F# looping constructs - <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>.
  We also looked at various examples that demonstrate situations where the imperative 
  programming style allows us to write some code in easier way than when implementing the
  same functionality in the purely functional way.</p>
<p>However, there are more imperative constructs that you may sometimes need than just 
  imperative <code>return</code>. In particular, many of the F# users sometimes ask for
  <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. Indeed, both of these can be added to our
  computation builder. We'll need to do a minor change to the way we represent the computation,
  but as you'll see in the next article of this series, it is definitely possible to do that
  and it can be done in a very syntactically convenient way.</p>
