    }<h1>PLDI 2010 Trip Report</h1>
<p>In June, I attended my first "big" academic conference <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/pldi10" type="external">Programming 
  Languages Design and Implementation (PLDI 2010)</a> in Toronto. I attended the conference, because
  I presented a paper that I wrote with Don Syme as a result of my internship at Microsoft Research, but
  I'll write more about that shortly (and thanks to MSR for partly supporting my attendance at the conference!)</p>
  
<p>As far as I understand it, the 
  focus of the conference is more on <em>implementation</em>. Many people believe that the current 
  programming languages are good enough and we need to make sure that they run well (e.g. compilers 
  optimize code to run better on multi-core) and that we need better tools for working with them 
  (e.g. automatic verification of the code we write), so these areas were the main focus of the
  conference. However, there were some very interesting talks on the <em>design</em> of programming 
  languages, which is an area that I personally find more interesting...
</p>

<h2>Garbage Collection in Reactive Scenario</h2>
<p>I presented a paper named <strong>Collecting Hollywood’s Garbage: Avoiding Space-Leaks in 
  Composite Events</strong> at the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ISMM10/">International Symposium
  on Memory Management (ISMM 2010)</a>, which is a workshop co-located with the main conference.
  The symposium focuses on various theoretical problems of garbage collection, real-time garbage
  collection as well as efficient (and concurrent) implementations of GC algorithms.</p>
  
<p>My work was somewhat more general and I tried to point out that the usual garbage collection 
  techniques do not work well in some scenarios - in particular in <em>reactive programming</em>.
  This is an observation that many WPF developers already know. This is a reason why we have 
  so-called <a type="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970850.aspx">Weak Event pattern</a>.
  However, the motivation for my talk was different (arising from the use of F# event combinators
  such as <code>Event.map</code>) and perhaps more fundamental. Here is a brief summary of my talk:</p>

<p style="margin-left:3em; margin-right:3em; font-style:italic;">If we mix the declarative 
  and imperative programming style, which is usual in languages like F# it becomes easy to 
  introduce patterns where the usual garbage collector for objects cannot automatically
  dispose all components that we intuitively consider garbage. We present a duality between 
  the definitions of garbage for objects and events. In particular, an <em>object</em> is
  <em>garbage</em> if it cannot be reached from any root objects, but an <em>event</em> is
  <em>garbage</em> if it doesn't lead to any leaf event that causes some imperative action
  (in .NET terminology, has an event handler attached). We combine the two dual notions
  into a single definition that can be used for collecting garbage in a reactive programming
  model in a mixed functional/imperative language. We present a garbage collection
  algorithm for this mixed theoretical model and, more importantly, we use the principle
  to implement a correct reactive library for F#.</p>

<p>After the talk, Dave Detlefs (who works in the CLR team at Microsoft) asked a very interesting
  question - How do we identify what is an "event" and what is an "object" in the runtime? In my
  theoretical model, these two are explicitly separated, but in a real-world (e.g. .NET) they would 
  both be some kind of objects. One interesting point about "event" is that it can only trigger 
  other events, but never receives any value back from them. This means that "event" should only
  call methods that return <code>void</code>. However, this is an interesting problem that deserves
  further research...</p>

<h2>Interesting talks from PLDI</h2>
<p>The main conference contained a large number of interesting talks. Here is a brief summary
  of the talks that I found particularly interesting - mostly because they are in some ways related
  to my interests (such as F#, functional programming and web programming): </p>

<h3>Safe Programmable Speculative Parallelism</h3> 
<p style="font-style:italic">(P. Prabhu, G. Ramalingam, K. Vaswani)</p>
<p>If we have a <code>for</code> loop where every iteration is independent of all other 
  iterations (e.g. do not rely on some state calculated by previous iterations), we can 
  easily parallelize the loop, for example, by creating a new task for every iteration.
  Unfortunately, this isn't always possible as many loops keep some state. <em>Speculative
  parallelism</em> provides a way for solving this - we specify a <em>prediction function</em>
  that attempts to guess the next state (without consuming much resources), so that we can
  run the next iteration in parallel. If the guess was correct, we calculated multiple 
  values in parallel. If no, we need to recalculate the values that depend on the current 
  result. The paper presents a static verification algorithm that checks whether the "recalculation"
  needs to rollback some side-effects (which would be impossible). The authors also presented 
  a C# library, which allows us to write something like this:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
Speculation.Iterate(0, numTasks,
  (i, state) =&gt; {
    // Body of the stateful loop 
    // - calculate new state based on current 'state' and index 'i'
  }, (i) =&gt;
    // Prediction function
    // - calculate new state without knowing the current 'state'
  });
</pre>
<p>This raises some interesting problems for F# as well. It turns out that encoding this
  style of computations using <em>computation expressions</em> isn't easy, because we need to
  write two functions for every step (while <em>computation expressions</em> or <em>monads</em>
  use only a single continuation). If you know about similar types of computations where
  we need two (or more) functions, I would be quite interested in hearing about them!</p>

<h3>Ur: Statically-Typed Metaprogramming with Type-Level Record Computation</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic">(A. Chlipala)</p>
<p>This talk caught my interest because it discussed a language for web programming 
  that appeared to be quite related to what I did some time ago in my <a href="http://tomasp.net/projects/fswebtools.aspx">F# Web Tools</a>
  (and indeed, also related to the work by the Links team in Edinburgh). The key topic of the
  presented paper was a bit different though. The language has a type-system where a type
  can depend on some computation (<em>dependent types</em>) and focuses on programming with
  record types and names (which is a very natural way to map SQL databases to a functional
  language). Some interesting uses of this technique include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Versioning</strong> - we can write a (type-safe) reusable function that translates an 
    old version of (any) table to a new version given a few properties (such as name of the
    primary key and names of new columns).</li>
  <li><strong>Grids</strong> - we can write a reusable function that generates grid for viewing and
    editing data and takes the type of the table as parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is something that is possible in F#/.NET only using dynamic reflection that analyzes values
  and types at runtime. Dependent types make it possible to write this kind of generic code more 
  directly (and in a type-safe way).</p>

<h3>Complete Functional Synthesis</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic">(V. Kuncak, M. Mayer, R. Piskac, P. Suter)</p>
<p>The authors present an extension of the Scala language that allows us to write a 
  <em>specification</em> of value (typically a number) that we want to get as the result 
  and automatically constructs (<em>synthesizes</em>) code to calculate the number. The
  specification is simply a Boolean expression that specifies what properties should hold
  about the value. For example, say we have a value <code>totsec</code> specifying
  a total number of seconds and we want to convert it to the <code>hh:mm::ss</code> format. Using the
  new <code>choose</code> construct, we can write:</p>
<pre>
val (hours, minutes, seconds) = 
  choose((h: Int, m: Int, s: Int) =&gt;
    h * 3600 + m * 60 + s == totsec &amp;&amp;
    0 &lt;= m &amp;&amp; m &lt;= 60 &amp;&amp;
    0 &lt;= s &amp;&amp; s &lt;= 60 &amp;&amp;
    0 &lt;= h)</pre>
<p>This is a bit like generalized pattern matching that makes the language even more 
  declarative. The compiler is smart enough to know whether it can always find a single 
  unique solution to the specification - if that's the case it emits a warning (because
  we want to avoid introducing non-determinism to our code). This is certainly an 
  interesting extension and I can easily imagine using it in F# (where it could be probably
  quite nicely implemented using quotations...)</p>

<h3>Traceable Data Types for Self-Adjusting Computation</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic">(Umut A. Acar et al.)</p>
<p>The paper presents an easy and efficient way of writing <em>self-adjusting</em> computations
  in a ML-like language. To example what that means, here is a quote from the abstract: <em>"Self-adjusting 
  computation provides an evaluation model where computations can respond automatically to 
  modifications to their data by using a mechanism for propagating modifications through
  the computation."</em> This means that we create some functional data-structure (e.g. queue) or
  perform some computation (e.g. heapsort) that uses some input data. When the input data change,
  we would typically need to remove some elements to recover the data-structure (sort the list again
  or rebuild the queue).</p>

<p>When using <em>self-adjusting computations</em>, the compiler 
  automatically keeps track of how the data structure was created and performs the necessary 
  updates. It would re-run the part of the computation (used to construct the data-structure) that
  is different than in the original run. This seems like an interesting technique that could
  be used for writing some efficient functional data-structures...</p>

<h2>Programming Languages for Web (APLWACA)</h2>
<p>Another event that was held as part of the PLDI conference was the 
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/APLWACA2010/default.html">APLWACA</a>
  workshop (the long acronym includes keywords like <em>programming languages</em>, <em>cloud</em> and also <em>web</em>).
  The workshop was organized for the first time and was very interesting (it is unfortunate that
  something like this didn't exist a few years ago, because it would be a perfect venue for my
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/fswebtools/files/fswebtoolkit-ml.pdf">draft paper about F# Web Tools</a>, which was
  never published anywhere). Anyway, it is great to know that there is a place for meeting people
  interested  in this kind of topics from an academic perspective!
  I'm surely planning to submit something next year (if it will be held again - and I hope it will)</p>

<p>Some of the topics discussed at the workshop this year included security of JavaScript
  (which is a tricky topic if you want to forbid third-party code to use some features of JavaScript
  such as <code>XmlHttpRequest</code>, but is very important for sites like Facebook). Another
  topic that caught my attention was a discussion of the semantics of the <a href="http://hop.inria.fr/" type="external">HOP language</a>,
  which is a language for programming interactive client/server web applications.</p>
