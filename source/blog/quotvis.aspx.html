    }<h1>F# quotations visualizer</h1>


<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">explained</a> what F# quotations are
  and I explained how you can do some simple manipulations with it. In this article I'd like to 
  present an application that I wrote and that can be helpful when working with quotations. 
  It displays clear graphical representation of given F# quotation (using Windows Forms TreeView control).
  </p>

<h2>F# quotations</h2>
<p>This application works with raw quotations (this means the internal representation that is used when
  writing quotation compilers). You can get F# quotations using <code>&lt;@@@@ ... @@@@&gt;</code> operator 
  and the type of raw quotations is <code>expr</code>. The <code>expr</code> type is following discriminated union:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
type expr =
  | ConstExpr  of exprConstr * dtype list
  | VarExpr    of exprVarName
  | QuoteExpr  of expr 
  | LambdaExpr of exprVar * expr 
  | AppExpr    of expr * expr
  | HoleExpr   of dtype 
</pre>  
<p>You can see that there are only a few types of quotations, but when you are writing application 
  that works with quotations, you can use set of object that provide simpler view on quotations structure.
  These objects (name starts with letters <code>ef</code>) can be found in the <code>Raw</code> namespace (see <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/fsharp-manual/fslib/Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Raw.html">F# manual</a>
  [<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/fsharp-manual/fslib/Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Raw.html" target="_blank">^</a>]). 
  All these objects have <code>Query</code> method that expects parameter of type <code>expr</code> and that either
  splits given expression into several sub-expressions or returns <code>None</code> (if parameter doesn't match). 
  So let's look at the example:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">let q = &lt;@@@@ if (a = 0) then 1 else 2 @@@@&gt;</pre>  
<p>This is the quotation that represents conditional expression, but it is internally stored using <code>AppExpr</code> 
  (one variant of discriminated union), but you can use the <code>efCond.Query</code> method to test whether it is
  conditional expression and you can also get expression that represents the condition and expressions representing
  both true and false branches.</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Test whether q is conditional expression using efCond.Query
match Raw.efCond.Query q with
  | Some (_,(cond,trueBranch,falseBranch)) -&gt;
      // cond        - 'expr' that represents condition
      // trueBranch  - 'expr' that represents the true branch
      // falseBranch - 'expr' that represents the false branch
      print_string "If-then-else statement"
      
  | None -&gt; 
      print_string "Something else"
</pre>  
<p>This was just a few words to explain what the application does and to help you understand the 
  source code of the most interesting part of application that builds the TreeView tree.</p>

<h2>Application features</h2>
<p>The application contains a few interesting features that I'd like to mention. If you look at 
  the right panel, it contains section called 'settings'. In this section you can configure
  how should the tree representation be built. Using the first checkbox you can say, whether
  the function calls in tree should be displayed as single function applications (more functional
  approach) or as series of function applications (more imperative approach). To see the difference
  look at the following screenshots:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis/qv_apps_exp.gif" target="_blank"><img style="margin:10px;border-style:none;" src="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis/qv_apps_exp_sm.gif" alt="Quotation Visualizer" /></a>

</div>
<p>If you check the second option, visualizer will call <code>deepMacroExpandUntil</code> function 
  before displaying the quotation tree. This function performs some simplifications on
  quotation before it is displayed. At first, the top level definitions are expanded and
  it also performs beta reduction which means that any local binding are replaced by 
  its value. For example <code>let a=5 in a+a</code> will be reduced to <code>5+5</code>.
  (This is the reason why complicated example from the first screenshot looks so simple
  at the second and third screenshot)</p>
  
<h2>Source code</h2>  
<p>I won't describe the complete source code (you can download it and look at it), but
  I'd like to describe how is the code organized so you can easily find what you want.
  The application is divided into several files (FS file contains the implementation and
  FSI file contains interface of the module).</p>
<p>The <code>Main</code> function that launches the application can be found in the 
  <code>main.fs</code> file. This file also contains a few quotations that are displayed
  when application starts. The main form called can be found in the <code>gui.fs</code>
  module. This module also contains dialog box that is displayed when user clicks
  on the "Add new quotation" link (this form is called <code>EnterCodeDialog</code>) 
  and class inherited from Windows Forms <code>TabPage</code> that displays
  given <code>expr</code> in a <code>TreeView</code> control.</p>  
<p>The last two modules are much more interesting. The <code>visualizer.fs</code>
  contains function <code>getExpressionTree</code> that takes F# quotation and
  builds the TreeView tree. This file contains code that matches given expression
  with several expression families like <code>efApp</code>, <code>efMethodCall</code> 
  and other (but it is still not complete). The last module is <code>compiler.fs</code>
  and it contains function that takes string entered by user and returns object 
  representation of F# quotation. This function simply calls <code>fsc.exe</code>
  and loads the value from the compiled assembly using reflection.</p>  
<p>The solution also contains one C# project (called Resources). I created this
  project because the F# application contains resources and I wanted to use <code>resx</code>
  designer in Visual Studio to easily create resource files. The main F# application
  just takes compiled resources (the file named <code>Resources.Main.resources</code> 
  in the <code>obj</code> directory).</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>  
<p>Using is pretty simple, so I won't describe it, however there are a few details that I want 
  to mention. First, the application uses F# libraries (fslib.dll), but I created one package that
  contains required libraries, so you can look at the application without installing F#. 
  Also if you want to be able to add F# quotations at runtime, you have to install F#, because
  adding quotations uses F# compiler (<code>fsc.exe</code>). You also have to set the correct
  path to the <code>fsc.exe</code> in application config file (<code>quotvis.exe.config</code>).</p>
